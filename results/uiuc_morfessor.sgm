<p>
<seg id="1">one of the causes of the success of the elegant of space is undoubtedly that in the case of the search for a united physical theory is not about boring story . </seg>
<seg id="2">the physical fundamental problem between two key theories ( after all , at the moment , our space de facto divided into two worlds with different law y) address and resolve this urgency and imagination , that it is worth převyprávění even a layman . </seg>
<seg id="3">we are with the complex material , moreover , advise so svěže and engaging , that is to say , some interesting to their books not included . </seg>
<seg id="4">moreover , its " mistake " largely corrected in the next two books : the structure of the space and hidden reality . </seg>
<seg id="5">even the author , nothing would senseless against his book , if it becomes out more quickly , but the fact is that , even after 15 years elegant space provides an almost everything , as informed , with his ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of the theoretical physics . </seg>
<seg id="6">it is quite likely that in the coming years will be in this area , after all , a little živěji ( to be due to the fact that the accelerator l h c is finally on " full gas " ), and this is a good time to enter into a green not forcibly open the doors of the world of modern physics . </seg>
<seg id="7">few dimensions may have our space ? </seg>
<seg id="8">the idea that our space is perhaps more than three spatial dimension y, can certainly be silly , a fantastically , strangely or myst . </seg>
<seg id="9">nevertheless , it is a concrete and totally unacceptable . </seg>
<seg id="10">we understand that , at the moment we odvrať its eyes from space as a whole to something přízemnější , namely the long and tenké gardeners had a on watering . </seg>
<seg id="11">imagine i, that had a hundred @-@ metre gardeners natáh kaňonu you from one side , on the other , and the entire scen the following from půlkilometrové distances ( as on that and on the side of the ). </seg>
<seg id="12">from a distance easy for you long in water equal respect only had a , but if it is not you suffer a bright rakostí , while you are on track width had hardly . </seg>
<seg id="13">given its long distances from had : you have thought that the grasshoppers i, a forced to live in a has had only one dimension , which can be : the left - the dimension along had not . </seg>
<seg id="14">if you ask someone , where he was an grasshoppers at the time , you say , only one information : grasshoppers to distance from the left ( or the ) had not end . </seg>
<seg id="15">all we want to say is that of půlkilometrové distances looks like a long had : as a one @-@ dimensional objects . </seg>
<seg id="16">in the real world that has had the width . </seg>
<seg id="17">we will see if all increase me, suddenly second dimension - in the shape of the kruž ovíjející had force . </seg>
<seg id="18">in such a zvětšeném perspective , it is evident that the grasshoppers person can actually move in two independent dimensions : in the well @-@ known has already left - a true dimension of the length of had , but also in " dimension in / against respect movement @-@ hour ručiček ", therefore around the world had ovéhoprůřezu is . </seg>
<seg id="19">you understand that , to determine the position of small grasshoppers ečka you need to add two figures : how far from the end of had and where it is kruž ovíjející had a Directive . </seg>
<seg id="20">this reflects the fact that the surface had : it is two @-@ dimensional ( amended n . experts observation that this chapter focuses solely on a theory disorders disregard running . </seg>
<seg id="21">no disruption of the aspects of the debate on 12 and 13 chapters ). . </seg>
<seg id="22">the surface had : it is two @-@ dimensional : one long to élná dimension is znázorněna direct šip kou, dimension in the direction of district u, marked circular šip kou, is short and svinutá . </seg>
<seg id="23">between these two dimensions , however , is a clear difference . </seg>
<seg id="24">dimension along had : it is a long and easily visible . </seg>
<seg id="25">dimension ovíjející district had : it is short , " svinutý " and less noticeable . </seg>
<seg id="26">to the existence of a circular dimension realised , we have had a review with a much better distinction . </seg>
<seg id="27">this example illustrates the important features of the scope of the dimensions . </seg>
<seg id="28">that is divided into two groups . </seg>
<seg id="29">they can either be large , vast and therefore directly visible , or , on the contrary , small svinuté and much less observer . </seg>
<seg id="30">of course , in this particular case , we are just not předřel i, " with to blame the " dimension ovíjející width had is exposed . </seg>
<seg id="31">you have taken to help far perspective . </seg>
<seg id="32">but if I had not been dwindling - as vlas or kapilára - with the blame the dimension we discovered only with great vigour . </seg>
<seg id="33">the sludge for sent in 1919 , ein you its Article ek, in which come out with astonishing kou, thought that spatial geometry space could have more than three us all known dimension . </seg>
<seg id="34">my radical claims the sludge for justified by the fact that additional dimension provides elegant and convincing framework in which you can be ein innovation and the general relatively and x we Rull the Electromagnetic a theory veto by into a single , united with mové structures . </seg>
<seg id="35">now the question is how this ka, sludge zův observation together with an obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of the area . </seg>
<seg id="36">the answer that the sludge for quietly expected between the lines , which spoke out clearly and clarify the Swedish maths on axes cardio generally in in @-@ 19 , 26 , stands or falls with the assertion that spatial geometry of our space can have both large and svinuté dimension . </seg>
<seg id="37">this means that , as well as dimension in the direction of the length of may have had our space large , vast and plain to see three dimensions , whose existence is every moment we are aware . </seg>
<seg id="38">but , by analogy with the world &apos;s district of gardeners may have had space additional dimension , firmly svinuté into the area so evident that still remain hidden even before our most perfectly @-@ experimental aparat ur ami. </seg>
<seg id="39">so we can get a clearer picture of the substance of the sludge from the remarkable proposal u, let us even for a moment , had it . </seg>
<seg id="40">imagine i, at constituency that we had in the paints a black colour quite a dense many kružnic . </seg>
<seg id="41">appear to be had still as a fine a one @-@ line . </seg>
<seg id="42">with a view to now thanks kresbě reveal the blame the dimension of even more easily , we will see that the motives of that 2 . </seg>
<seg id="43">clearly see that had me, surface is a two @-@ dimensional , with one &apos;s great and almost unlimited and with the other short and circle ovou. </seg>
<seg id="44">the sludge for and generally in came up with the idea that our kou, space is a similar structures u, but apart from one small circular dimension has three major spatial dimension , together , čtyřiprostorové dimension . </seg>
<seg id="45">it is difficult to draw up objects with too many dimension . </seg>
<seg id="46">to my imagination i, little help us are illustrative of the 3 ; it shows the two large dimension and one small circular dimension . </seg>
<seg id="47">the increases that we look at the standards of the area , as we had is widening the surface . </seg>
<seg id="48">each of the following level represents a huge increase in the area of geometry of previous levels . </seg>
<seg id="49">our space may have additional dimension ( we see is the fourth level increasing ), if they are to blame those into sufficiently small area ; that we make it clear that we are still not observed . </seg>
<seg id="50">čtvercová network shows commonly known " large " dimension , while the new malin kruž , and with the blame the dimension . </seg>
<seg id="51">just as the loop thread in densely were a koberci , these kruž Directive exist in every place the usual proportions - we have only is due to the opinion for only to produce drawings průsečíků in čtvercové network . </seg>
<seg id="52">the background that 4 shows commonly known structure area - ordinary the world around us - in such ordinary měřítká , such as metres , znázorněný of party small čtverečku in čtvercové network . </seg>
<seg id="53">for any subsequent that we focus on small area that the previous ; we will ji, to become visible . </seg>
<seg id="54">initially , nothing special is not happening , as we can see in the first few levels increase . </seg>
<seg id="55">however , when we move on its path for microscopic properties geometry area on - the fourth level of increase in that of 3 - we will see a new , suddenly into shape kruž Directive with the blame this dimension , similar to smyčkám in densely tkan a piece of carpet . </seg>
<seg id="56">the sludge for and generally in came up with the idea that additional kou, the dimension exists at any point in the direction of the great dimensions , as it has had the constituency at any point in its length ky. </seg>
<seg id="57">in the interests of the opinion that we have the dimension to produce drawings only in some , regularly spread over a number of points . </seg>
<seg id="58">sludge from a 4 and generally innovative ideas about microscopic geometry summarises the structure of the area . </seg>
<seg id="59">similarity with hadicí is obvious , even though we are important differences . </seg>
<seg id="60">firstly , space has three large , far a spatial dimensions ( of which we have to produce drawings only two ), while may have had great dimension only one . </seg>
<seg id="61">even more important difference lies in the fact that we are now talking about spatial exponentially and space itself , not just on any subject within the space u, must be our had force . </seg>
<seg id="62">the basic idea but it is the same . </seg>
<seg id="63">if it is the additional circle &apos;s svinutá dimension extremely miniature , recognise it is - as well as the district had not - much harder than to observe the obvious , large and vast dimension . </seg>
<seg id="64">if it is the size of the additional dimension sufficiently small , to detect it will , in fact , the strength of our most modern instruments on making . </seg>
<seg id="65">the most important thing is that the additional dimension is not a mere oblým hrbol of within the normal proportions , as two @-@ to @-@ one of mistakenly indicated . </seg>
<seg id="66">circular dimension is a new dimension em, which exists in any point three ordinary vast proportions . </seg>
<seg id="67">this is a dimension to the remaining three dimensions of the independent as well , such as the dimensions of the top @-@ down on the right , the left - and zepředu - backwards independent ( and kolmé ) each other . </seg>
<seg id="68">sufficiently small grasshoppers laden could move in all four dimensions and to define its position we need four data , apart from the three normal even position in the circular dimension ; if we include the time then data five , in any case , one knows ce, than we normally expect . </seg>
<seg id="69">by you ? </seg>
<seg id="70">the book elegant space bringing Ian Lundgren woman , you can buy here on the books . today . c of . </seg>
<seg id="71">the cost of e @-@ books , 149 , - kč . </seg>
<seg id="72">to our surprise , therefore , we see that , although we are aware of the existence of the only three dimensions , shows the sludge from &apos;s and generally innovation on the thinking that this is not excluded the existence of additional svinutý proportions if they are sufficiently small . </seg>
<seg id="73">space can be easily proportions , more than we can see a on . </seg>
<seg id="74">as a small should be ? </seg>
<seg id="75">the latest technical equipment can recognise the structures of a billion billion of standards . </seg>
<seg id="76">smaller svinuté dimension can hardly be careful . </seg>

<seg id="8">although the majority of profit from the large states as California ie, new of ork and xenophobia and , it seems that the same situation is in Washington . </seg>

<seg id="2">the second basic lies with the national a, is faith and of the sacrosanct texts were drawn up God and not the real human author . </seg>
<seg id="3">when people talk about one of the many things that are at odds with their religion , often us put a question to you believe it? u: </seg>
<seg id="4">the alleged God word u, or word man ? </seg>
<seg id="5">as if human examination was absolutely nothing at all in comparison with the authority which they have their doctrine . </seg>

<seg id="9">why would otherwise all of these things have y? </seg>
<seg id="10">it seems as if we have tried to say something ! </seg>
<seg id="11">people do not create any of these things . </seg>
<seg id="12">however , the people of their ability to tell the story y, bul technology . </seg>
<seg id="13">it was people who wrote and all the text y, which they pretend they are word of God . </seg>
<seg id="14">every allegedly holy learning any religion in the world describes itself as sepsané people , not God . </seg>
<seg id="15">people who have been " moved " or " inspired by " their popular God y, or to listen to the dictates of angels , but these texts were not drawn up by anyone other than just death collaboratively with a certain degree of imagination , not anděly not God . </seg>
<seg id="16">if we really had a real god , it would be an integral part of all bohů all religions , über-galaktický super @-@ genius , ultimátní entities and the whole cosmetics . </seg>
<seg id="17">if the person of such size sometimes wrote a book u, there would be only one such paper , the only print holy . </seg>
<seg id="18">it would be known everywhere in the world , without predecessors , parallel or alternative in whatever language , because the mere lidští authors , with such a difference could not measured . </seg>
<seg id="19">and they are not blind trust , because it would be consistent , backed up by verifiable and correct and clear evidence y, would deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limit . </seg>
<seg id="20">permanently would inspired and any reader to the unity of the common belief . </seg>
<seg id="21">if it wrote god , we do not expect nothing less . </seg>
<seg id="22">however , what we have instead is the exact opposite . </seg>
<seg id="23">instead of a single religion leading to a final truth we have many different religions without a common origin and all are constantly being eroded in the increasingly separate de nomination , seeking the truth and disputed each have somehow claiming God leadership , regardless of the continuing the bíha and decoupling in any way . </seg>
<seg id="24">Jewish tór a, Christian Gospel a, Islamic Koran , bahá'u'lláhův zarathuštr kitáb-i-akdás , education and Embedded y, sikh adí - the grant h , hard bharátská b ha Garriga fly @-@ g , paper by the plague or Paper ur anti @-@ all considered " absolute right " " clearly and the floor only the God " and non @-@ believers each of them are saying that the others are in the wild . </seg>
<seg id="25">the only logical explanation is probably that misled by are , to a certain extent we all . </seg>
<seg id="26">none of the aforementioned books is not against the other any benefits . </seg>
<seg id="27">none of them has the backing and no cannot be historically confirm . </seg>
<seg id="28">I will name , Dr Mr ul and even &apos; , and I am Professor Ancient history in Western @-@ iganské university . </seg>
<seg id="29">I am not saying that I have shown that the Bible is reliable and historic accurate . </seg>
<seg id="30">of course , it is not . </seg>
<seg id="31">well , you must have faith . </seg>
<seg id="32">all of these require faith and also apologia ( defence ), because they contain irregularity i, absurdity and primitive ideas once considered true that have already been overcome . </seg>
<seg id="33">so we cannot claim that they are proof božské wisdom . </seg>
<seg id="34">many of them is appalling atrocities instead of decency and many of them have claimed that they were confirmed the fulfilment of prophecy - with the fact that every also may contain prophecy which has not been implemented . </seg>
<seg id="35">the leading teolog admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written in human ýma hands and therefore are the subject of interpretation , images and of their primitive and often prejudices connected politically motivated authors , thus explaining to many of the contradictions and irregularities in these books , particularly those in Bibles . </seg>
<seg id="36">I would not called contradictions , mutual comments . </seg>
<seg id="37">we must once again to point out that there are two different author y, whose work was somehow smíchána together during any editor of the review . </seg>
<seg id="38">it is right that genes is more than one of the author and certainly not to právěním week of an ! </seg>
<seg id="39">some experts now distinguish four different sources just for the transit routes that you , i.e. five books " of mojžíšový " and mojžíš , not with as authorship any of them , because almost certainly did not exist , as it is in Bibles described . </seg>
<seg id="40">experts agree that genes is has been comprised ( probably ezdráš ) from several and relatives oral traditions less than 2 500 years ago . </seg>
<seg id="41">other documents have been přefiltrovány at the same time , and all of them are attributed to human authors . </seg>
<seg id="42">the Bible is not in any way as old as its believers . </seg>
<seg id="43">since the dawn of dead Sea are the older archaeological text by the findings of the well @-@ known for its unfinished basis all Western monotheistic faiths , and yet there are many centuries younger than roots zoroastr iánství , Buddhist ismu, Hindu ismu, ismu, druidský Group of culture , of the Chinese or the Egyptian religion . </seg>
<seg id="44">Christianity began as gno @-@ faith a, follow docéti and ebionité and their completely different outlook on ježíše , which will ultimately combine in a sort of compromise entitled ortodox . </seg>
<seg id="45">other Christian groups as lui figure iáni were erosion and discredit váni other revisions Bible . </seg>
<seg id="46">one of these changes relates to the King of g in , who was a 3 500 years ago . </seg>
<seg id="47">because his successors had a major threat for young mojžíšké religion , the authors of the new law decided to mock and even ' al from bul a, " gentleman at the top " change to b operator zebuba " gentleman , ". </seg>
<seg id="48">so the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently pozměňována as of religious and political reasons . </seg>
<seg id="49">the remaining part of what has happened to the new law was kano nizována in the 4th century n . . in a series of komisní decisions at the Assembly in very ji. </seg>
<seg id="50">four Gospel was adopted and 16 other was rejected in the eye , as if the fact some things to accept or reject the vote . </seg>
<seg id="51">the way the kánon made dependent on what is četlo on Sundays in the Christian centres concentrated </seg>
<seg id="52">as četlo on the other Sunday after the great konocí in jeruzalemské church i? </seg>
<seg id="53">and what is in the Roman Church in the time ? </seg>
<seg id="54">and gradually find out that is close to those same Gospel very poor stories . </seg>
<seg id="55">and so the core kánonu such made from úzu initial churches . </seg>
<seg id="56">so all he simply adopted as gospel any relevant stories which circulating between not trained meat at this time . </seg>
<seg id="57">but just as they have received more than ten books of the Bible , although they covered books y, which were approved eny. </seg>
<seg id="58">the rejection items we find the dossiers as apoštolů and the Prophet . </seg>
<seg id="59">why should we God word should refer to books y, which are just words some people and / or even to i? </seg>
<seg id="60">there was a real processors who ? </seg>
<seg id="61">the Bible is often mentions human author . </seg>
<seg id="62">but how could be adopted ena, if their real the author of this arbitrary my and the reputation like , žalmové lyrics ? </seg>
<seg id="63">the Bible was certainly the tone of the people , and certainly not too enlightenment mi, rather the contrary ! </seg>
<seg id="64">that is the reason why it is so much of its content historically and scientifically completely wrong , whether in terms of almost anything from beginning to end . </seg>
<seg id="65">we are talking about people who believed that snakes and axes if they can speak , believed in spells , bloody i, ritual sacrifice games , očarované subject y, fire Members potions dreamt y, and the method and the five nature magic . </seg>
<seg id="66">thought with i, when used magic @-@ rod that someone disabled say blood , the cure it from le speech . </seg>
<seg id="67">we are talking about people who thought that are i, rabbits přežvýkavci and not topýři are birds and whales are fish and buy a whole number . </seg>
<seg id="68">they people believed that , when pregnant every cow her calf pruh will show the model y, give birth to pruh the calves . </seg>
<seg id="69">how would this could tell someone who knows something about genetics ? </seg>
<seg id="70">the authors of this paper , of course , it did not know . </seg>
<seg id="71">if the Bible was drawn up a higher beings , then it does not contain such errors , as it contains . </seg>
<seg id="72">if we go penned by actually superior being and was intended as a word for word the history , then it does not contain nothing at all from the fact that it contains . </seg>
<seg id="73">as a moral guide sounds totally fail because most of the original as Jewish &apos;s files was drawn up not educated and bigot by chaotic y, , who ignored or promote animal cruelty in road , slavery , abuse of slaves , abuse of family members , abuse of children , violence against children ech, abortion y, looting , murder , cannibalism with , genocide and prejudice against e, race , religion , gender or sexual orientation . </seg>
<seg id="74">to defend its inhumanity by saying that , God will take place . </seg>
<seg id="75">however , kreacionisté all this is still being ignored . </seg>
<seg id="76">some of their websites admit that , if there is any fact in conflict with the Bible , then it must be the fact ignored ! </seg>
<seg id="77">and why ? </seg>
<seg id="78">because if kreacionisté should not their loved ones books y, should not even God . </seg>
<seg id="79">in their world is one and the same thing . </seg>
<seg id="80">it is ironic that refuse to God " work " as " creature , instead of the cult of ". </seg>
<seg id="81">but you consider the word for word to God and God itself and even maintain that the return of their allegedly " " holy book any confounding God as such . </seg>
<seg id="82">not their version of God but all version of God . </seg>
<seg id="83">kreacionističtí Christians think that if the Bible wrong then god lie . </seg>
<seg id="84">it cannot accept that their could be and the Bible , at the same time , could be wrong , because it cannot be dissociated from bož doctrine . </seg>
<seg id="85">so it is a kind of modlářství where believers worshipping the man @-@ made compilations of , as if these books have been itself god , because I think that they are his words . </seg>
<seg id="86">only god never wrote not dictated by any of the files of any religion . </seg>
