the renewal of the very American ideal that labour rights are also human rights
kongresmeni keith ellison and john lewis proposed law, which is to organise a union protected as a civil law.
“depending on how they operate unions operate jobs for the middle class, ” says ellison, democratic Senator for minnesotu, which is the Co-Chair of the Committee.
therefore, I am so proud, together with a model of occasional rights johnem lewisem imagine the law which strengthens the position of the workers.
this far-reaching legislation will give workers the same legal possibilities how to prevent discrimination in organising in trade union, as with other forms of discrimination - and put a stop to the forces of protiodborové
to amend the law on labour relations, so as to allow all the staff who face discrimination, if we want to be involved in the trade unions, judge in a civilian court - and vysoudit compensation or compensation - it is right and necessary initiative.
certainly, but this is not a radical initiative - at least not according to the American standards.
the best way to understand what ellison, lewis and other proponents presented in the law, it is once again to follow up on the American ideal.
despite the fight, which have taken place in recent years - in wisconsinu, michiganu and other States - američani once supported countries around the world to accept, expanded and respect labour rights.
there was a time and millions of američanů is still remember when the country in the same breath to promote democracy, freedom of expression, freedom of the press, and the right to assembly.
when the United States after World War II, Japan, General douglas macarthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution drafted by so as to ensure that the military autocracy hideki toja will be replaced by democracy.
they believe that the workers and their trade unions play a role in shaping the new japonska, included in one language and openly acknowledged that “the right of workers to collect, collectively to negotiate and to act is guaranteed. ”
when the United States after the Second World War, a German, General dwight Michael eisenhower and his advisers němce encouraged to create a constitution, which will ensure that fascism adolfa hitlera will be replaced by a strong democracies.
němci realising that employees will be in the new people need to organise and promote and, therefore, include a clause, which openly says: “right to create alliances that will safeguard and improve employment and economic conditions will every individual and each profession or profession guaranteed.
arrangements that will have the right to restrict or will seek his damage will be abolished. measures leading to meet this purpose are unlawful.
when the former First Lady eleanor rooseveltová chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted in 1948, nations as global treaty, included in its proponents and rooseveltová guarantee that everyone has the right to the protection of their interests to trade unions and enter into them. ”
američané generations accept the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
when countries advising the other countries to create civil and democratic society, američané explained that the right to create labor unions - and their participation in the collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as an equal partner - must be protected.
now that these rights are in americe attacked, it is absolutely necessary to return to the US ideal that working people must have the right to a free and open society organise and promote.
as fifty years ago said reverend martin luther king jr.:
history is a teacher.
today, everyone knows that the strength of the nation nezmenšily, but have it.
raise the standard of living of millions of people, to create a market for industry and the production of lifted on netušenou level.
those who trade unions, attack, these simple truth forget history, but it is nevertheless.
history does not forget, and we should also not.
formal recognition of rights as human - and extending the protection of civil rights, so as to prevent discrimination in the organisation of the trade unions - is long overdue.
keith ellison and john lewis restore the ideals that have lifted ameriku and have made it a real commitment to democracy.

it was very clear that the decision concerns and doctors from two clinics, which were not between žalujícími, and also for granting this authorisation.
louisiana is between 11 States adopting similar laws, and the courts in alabamě and mississippi such measures the declared as unconstitutional.
a key part of the Texas law, which should be concluded by most of the remaining clinics in the state ’ s federal judge on Friday.
campaigners for women's right to abortion, together with American Obstetricians and of Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, argues that the need to have this authorisation on the doctor requests from medical terms, they are not necessary.
opponents of abortion opposed by measures aim to protect the health of women, and some also welcomed the fact that, due to the measure would be clinics.
Centre for reproductive rights have said that in louisianě has permission only one doctor implementing abortion.
if all doctors in the country were forced to stop with the implementation of abortion, the doctor, out of fear of its security also stop action to implement, said the group.

when the eastern dictator preach about democracy.
after putin on srazu their youth organisations, which reminds me most of all hitlerjugend, zachrastil with nuclear weapons and, in fact, everyone has made it clear that their views are stolen, he gave us a lecture on democracy.
however, I do feel that the current regime in rusku has many features of the fascist state.
the large nations have one thing in common, and that is that it can be as vypjatý nationalism, and that is that inferiority complex can transform the imperialist appetites.
time is passing on the East, otherwise, than in the West.
while the Western world thought that the wars on the control of evropou is long gone, in the East, thinks that were ignored for a long time, and it is necessary to buy back its international position.
such a mood and frustration in německu ruled in the 1930s, just before the ruthless power grab by the Nazis and then follow the eruption of nationalism quite today's situation in rusku.
and then the very same cult of a strong leader, beating up inconvenient journalists, the elimination of political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, so this is indeed quite similar.
vladimírovi putinovi and certainly also largely rusů perhaps nostalgic for the time when the Russian ruled half the world and the second part of the třásla before them.
perhaps it was caused by Western politicians themselves, perhaps a little vladimíra poplácávali after the shoulders, perhaps not invite him there where coveted and perhaps it began to be underestimated and he has simply been as typical Russian mužik.
did we get home, looked that he actually nowhere and brousil knives or at home.
now decided that dobude back lost position.

the leader is about to life, so where's haste.
on kavkazany now pošlape ukrajince, then at least trpaslíci from pobaltí.
those already in the Russian bear štípou kožichu long enough.
there has certainly take note of and čína that somehow power jump and certainly has designs on dálný East.
and those of štvou němci vladimíra too much, as well, and this is what I give them in 45 so up.
what do one new novorosiju in karlových Vary.
this would be základnička and there is a lot of and as there are stifling and daču already wanted leckterému from them.
after all, our veterans doteďka vzpomnají, as this československu should.
well, here is one of their prime minister reprezentacije i sobotka, it is so měký, it can be loupat like onions and I dream of the whole of their aanwezig.
it would thus led to large Russian vyskakovali.
it is necessary to remind them where they stand.
and as rozbušky, use our soukmenovce who live in their territory.
rusů abound, and when he says that there are stifling, so there is simply they oppress and that we do not, we protect them.
and, in turn, will be rus rule, after all, what else is zrozen.

so when I had a lot of a very large overweight and started to show signs of diabetes, doctor told me, “to do ” radical change.
so I began to go to a fitness centre and I had to stick to the imposition of a diet to waive the symptoms.
it is very difficult.
and tiring.
no one wants to eat same carrot.
the change in the direction of ubírání henryho careers may be reflected in its elegant, short ostříhané bradce.
after he received recognition from criticism for its othella, to the theatre.
followed ’ s full of errors and fences wilsona August.
it is a different experience than sitcomy and comedy which vyplňovaly his a hectic working life.
began when he was 16 and worked in the factory.
it has performance on the podium, as someone parody, and write about it in the competition for talent.
his television career began in the mid-1970 ’ s: “I have long been a single Black imitátor / Hollywood in television. ”
he is on the march.
in addition, that I had to take note of the public, I had to be too between 1975 and 1985 to learn how to invent a functioning jokes, be star and act on the television and it was really difficult.
lenny in new faces in 1975
given that its manager owned political rights for the production of the black and white minstrel show, entertainment programme, in which the actors adequate for blacks, henry it with its komedií finally addressed five years.
my family because it was uncomfortable.
a wish that this never happened, but nelituju it.
although it was a special and embarrassing position, I worked on large arenas and taught how to work with the crowd.
what was the “for years and years appreciated the main product of the British television, ” but was also“ grotesque parodie blacks. ”
in the 1980 ’ s henry worked in alternative komediálních circles and present figures, which also zesměšňovaly and were British black culture.
the first of a series of the lenny henry show began to send in 1984 and in the 1990 ’ s was, among other things, known as the chef gareth blacklock komediálním seriále in Sofia.
another decade, he worked advertising, documents, television series and role in the films, but after odvysílání his series lennyhenry.tv on bbc in 2008, he said: “so what you do now lene, a bit of it seems that you have zaseknul in one place, or a little scházíš from the road. ”
next was documentary on radio 4 called floor with great...? / what is so great...?
the first was shakespeare.
I had to shakespeara seriously.
in school, we have it properly neučili and I thought that this is something for white middle class.
so I should fear.
all those with whom we have done in the conversation, peter, trevor nunn, adrian lester, judi denchová, said: “should you try. ”
nenavážej into this when nevíš what we're talking about an.
zkus, a few words and uvidíš why we all have shakespeara so happy.
henry for the document presented two lines of othellovy concluding speech, and in fact went.
could I feel that I can.
as if this courage.
"it is on this. it is a serious matter, think of it seriously, learn the text to see something about that.
so the testing was hard, and before the game read months and months.
and it was a success.
it seemed that waiting mess, which is not the case.
soon began to play in comedy full error.
at the same time, I was in the National Theatre. I could not believe.
at one point I thought: “changed you. ”
there has been a technical problem shortly and henry instinctively felt that must take responsibility for the confiscation of audience.
“little voice in the head told me: ‘ than would turn out alright computer, you must now is 10 minutes talking. ’ ”
instead, the theatre director announced that performance will continue, as will solve the problem.
I left the stage and something in me said: “hm, thank God. ”
this is not my responsibility.
can it for me to someone else.
“play and zůstaň in part. ”
in the beautiful henry plotech duchess
learn to text fences was a challenge.
panic is quite good, with determination.
the game was also well received, so it is a sign of God, which says: "what you should do. ”
of course, it is resonant voice.
so there will remain.
I am glad that fact.
I am I in provisionally.
henrymu still remains the brain buffoon - all the time our conversation suspended humornými speeches, when entering and acts of the role of imitátora.
I have decided not to stand-upy, as have the satisfaction of room full of foreigners is a bit dangerous, I would say.
if we are looking for something, you can get to a dead end.
sometimes when I want, I do live at the apollo, but I do not enjoy as before.
I asked whether even sometimes to organise a stand-up tour.
welcome to sit in one room with German, which helps to make the contours of a beginning, means and the end of the road - I do not think that I, I sometimes give up.
so your new incarnation?
I think so.
acting I enjoy.
it is a fun.
every time that you spin for stories, which is excellent.
miluju stories.
people love stories.

models of services bbc have changed: today I headlines displayed on mobile phone and shows that I prošvihl, I can see iplayeru.
but bbc remains very beloved and wonderful institutions.
a wonderful director - I hope that one found.

an example of lauded new novel howarda jacobsona of love and 3.Restrictions “ownership ”
disperse, this is the best way to describe, gradually spread as kartonová boxes that someone left in the rain.
only from time to time a woman said that it is very serious, complex, rapid, isolated and perhaps a little popudlivý.
and then it has shaken hands.
popuzeně it acknowledged.
was shoot up, as ježek, yes.
the last victim of this his ability was incipient love pletka that more than usual promised that he will relieve from solitary the boredom, and perhaps also give some satisfaction.
ailinn solomonsová was fragile beauty with wild hřívou hairdryer and přelétavým heart of villages in the northern island, which was even odlehlejší and hostile than the port reuben.
in the south of the older escort, kevern believed that is its aunt, which inherited wealth in vlhkém, but the wonderful valley called, fitting paradisiacal valley.
in a few years, no one.
pipes prosakovaly in bathtubs were dead pavouci, slimáci with oslizle signed at the windows, as if they thought that they place belongs, garden was Suché and weeds resemble the huge hlávky cabbage.
the house looked like chaloupka of scary stories, and at the same time, a charming garden, with full secrets.
the profile of the author: howard jacobson, whose novel “ownership ” is on the candidate list of the nominations for the man booker prize 2014.
closer choice will be announced next week.
kevern with ailinn sat on rozkládacích seats in the long grass and hold hands, use the unexpected warm spring afternoon nepřítomně naladili public station that region zásobovala comforting music and some reassuring messages, when in fact he look at her opálené překřížené feet recall the old story long forgotten one black actor that zataženým roletami I listened to his father.
you have the power of large feet.
because of their natural aggressiveness, such songs in radio played.
were prohibited - actually banned nothing - simply is not played.
helping them to get to desuetuda, as well as the very word desuetudo.
popular tastes managed to what would never failed to regulations and standing outside the law, and just as people what comes to books, collect on his memoirs, in which the her become rich, kuchařky and domestic novels and music to collect ballad.
kavern was to tear down the day and began to play on the imaginary piáno and a severe, comical voice sang serenádu aillininým great on.
ailinn understand.
"it was popular song from the blues pianisty fatse wallera, ” he said and automatically to live two fingers to rtům.
it always made his father, when I to suppress the j than it emerges from the mouth.
it started as a game, when he was still small.
my father told him that the game played and with his father.
when you think the word what organizations were beginning to j, not a pusu two fingers, it has taken you penny.
already at that time it was not very funny and funny it was not even now.
only knew that this is expected of it, this was the whole.
had to explain what is a jazz.
no ailinn never heard.
or jazz, even if not directly outlawed, do not play.
improvisation came out of fashion.
in life was rather than just for one “if ”.
when a song, people want to know exactly where they end.
the same in the sense of humour.
his nepředvidatelnost went to the people on the nerves.
and jazz was humor expressed by the song.
although until ten years have not heard about sammy davisu juniorovi, knew kevern jazz from otcovy polotajné collections of old CD.
at least but not aillin say that fats waller was black.
because of their age, we could not remember the time when ’ s favorite singers were blacks.
also, without laws or pressure.
acquiescent society is one in which every part of with gratitude - with gratitude to those who have been happy chance of saving - agrees with the principle of a group of gratitude.
people afro-karibského origin, sightseeing destination and stature threw for bavení and atletiku, sang and ran.
people from the Indian subcontinent, nature talented for electronics, take responsibility for the fact that no family will not be without parliamentary phone.
poláci living, were plumbers, řekové living, washed dishes.
those in the Gulf States perského and sitting was closed, whose grandparents quickly did not abandon the country, while happened what happened, if that happened - were afraid that it is alleged that applied to the fire, worried that the fire next time spent is opened, restaurant, where the selling labneh and kouřily water cigar, neupozorňovali on themselves and inaction is slowly had.
each according to his talent.
given that had been listening only ballad, ailinn hard to understand how from sprostých words that her kavern just zazpíval could be successful.
music was an expression of love.
"in fact not sprostá kevern, ” he said.
perhaps only for the people, as they are very large.
my father never neurazil anyone, but the story was like.
too, but neglected garden gave the illusion of security.
behind the soundproofed sheets could not escape the floor.
ailinn still to understand.
why should your father something like?
I have to say that it was a joke, but was reluctant to give in its presence, two fingers to ústům.
they thought that it is strange.
“seemed to him, seven, ” he said.
disbelief has shaken head and eclipsed kevernovi perspective.
across the wide world did not see anything other than a jumble of its havraních hair.
nothing else to see.
“if, ” said pochybovačně.
but this still does not explain why it zpíváš.
look really rozčilená.
I have the power of large feet?
he looked again.
of this completely.
perhaps a little kotníky...
tvrdíš nesnášíš me, because I am very thick kotníky?
I hate?
this is not true.
this is just stupid song.
you could say to it “miluju, ” but it was very soon.
“your thick kotníky me just attract, ” tried it.
I am a bit úchylný.
it has failed.
I be vtipný.
when I be vtipný, it often got into trouble because, like his father, lacked the necessary in order to curb cruelty, which in vtipech číhala.
perhaps it was his father cruel deliberately.
perhaps it was deliberately cruel kavern.
despite his eyes.
ailinn solomonsová zrudla and put the couches, shodila radio and minimal nedopité wine.
bezinkové drinking wine, so that it could not.
look like that in its excitement chafing as palmové leaves the storm.
“I am zvráceně attracts that you kind, ” said...
to me it would.
he was her sorry, both because of his nelaskavým words, because of fear, which should in the eyes of when it is put.
she thought it uhodí?
spoken with him on the life of the cold northern peninsula, where the father, but doubted that the foundations that there was the same as here.
tříštil them the same have vast and the Arctic Ocean.
the same confusion of the men, then what happened, even more touchy, and quite mrzutější than their ancestors, smugglers and kazisvěti, naštvaně bloumali from pubs to pub, ready to apply in any woman who would opovážila is to refuse or to ridicule.
kind?
if we do not take care of those it their fist!
first it pomazlit - pomazlit has become the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: antibody mdlých balad of love which radio chrlilo - first it pomazli, then it one vraž.
in view of the excessive kevernova kultivovanost because fondling in itself was an act of violence.
ailinn solomonsová him nonverbally indicated that left.
picked up from the couches as'm an old man.
itself felt rozmrzelá, but the burden of his grief it surprised.
after all, it was not the end of the world.
almost is unknown.
watching out - as if it became aware of the window in the floor - a man caught up what he has done.
adam leaving garden, I thought.
the heart of her sevřelo because of it, as well as for all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few zbilo it.
a man from it away, shoulders svěšená, zahanbený, loser, all on the left him - why it felt that this view knows well, even if we failed to equip itself with a single moment until today, that this would have ever seen?
ailinn solomonsová, in turn, look at their feet.
about 20 years after these events esme nussbaumová, intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old female researchers working in ofnow nestatutárním monitoring system, public sentiment, a short article on the persistence of small and medium-sized heavy violent acts in areas of the country where the mitigate or directly stop, most anticipated, if his removal was made enough money and energy.
“has done a great deal and still do must, ” wrote,“ to calm the inherent aggressiveness of people who have fought in many battles and most of them have won, and particularly in zasutých, hard-to-reach parts of the country, where, despite the leaders church towers, acting on living fences ring human kindness historically been rarely. ”
some things are irreplaceable.
it would seem that the higher the ring tower, the lower are instincts.
the people of vzdychají over sentimentálními baladami, are devouring unfortunate stories and argue that firmly believes in the value of marriage and family life, but not only in rurálních areas with old brutality is equally stubbornly as in urban conurbations, but the evidence also show that at home, in the workplace, roads, and even to sports ground is new and offensive intolerance.
"unfortunately you have tended to too květnatému style, ” he told her boss.
I would suggest you read less novels.
esme nussbaumová sklonila head.
also, I have to ask: are you ateistka?
“I have the impression that there is no need to respond, ” said esme nussbaumová.
you lesba?
esme once again protested their right to privacy and silence.
feministka?
another silence.
“not therefore ultimately rabinowitz, ” he said,“ I have anything against ateistům, lesbám or feministkám.
in the workplace prejudices do not.
we serve nepředpojaté society.
but a kind of hypersensitivity, which itself is completely acceptable and commendable, may sometimes distort judgment, as you have demonstrated.
obviously, you yourself have prejudiced against the Church - things that you call “brutal ” and“ brutal ” would others could be interpreted as a statement of natural forces and energy.
still address what happened, if that happened, as if that were to happen, if that happened, yesterday, a country with its basic living force.
while rabinowitz spoke, esme nussbaumová with rozhlížela around.
as head of light board růžově blikalo recommendations which ofnow send to the world of the last quarter-century, or more.
usmívejte the neighbor pečujte on its partner, listen ballad, choďte on muzikály, use your phone konverzujte, explain, dohodněte, please excuse.
talk is better than remain silent zpívané word is better than written, but there is nothing better than love.
“I fully understand your reservations, ” said quietly esme nussbaumová when was sure that its superior ended,“ and I am not saying that morning nezhojila as namlouváme that zhojila.
my concern, in particular, is that, if it is not made in advance, we will repeat the same mistake, which led to what has happened, if this happened.
this time, but anger and mistrust, we will not be vented on the other.
luther rabinowitz linked ends fingerprints.
this should have marked endless patience.
“you treat your too far, ” he said,“ when the steps that may have done and perhaps do your grandparents, you describe as errors.
too much you treat your and that you are talking about the fact that the ventilovali its “anger ” and“ mistrust ” in the “other. ”
I would not someone on your site to recall that, in view of the past and present, we are not talking about the “us ” and“ them ”.
there was no “us ” and“ no. ”
we know that it was only a chaotic times.
"during which, to be honest, ” has collected esme courage,“ no, we are not free of blame.
anyone neobviňuju.
whether it was fair or not, what has happened has happened.
it was before.
this is not to say - in this agreement.
as there is no fault, which would be to bring, nor are there things that should be corrected, even if the remedy is suitable and perhaps.
but what else is past, than to have learnt -
the past is there to be forgotten.
if I can add something -
luther rabinowitz rozpojil ends fingerprints.
“your report will take into account, ” he said and release it.

the increasing uncertainty trade demonstrably hit - and, in particular, consumer confidence, which is likely to cause that some order will be postponed or even lifted, mainly the most expensive.

ten years of hell survivors from beslanu: ten years on from the horrors of the occupied school children are still suffering
ten years ago, the Chechen radicals in school in beslanu in southern rusku hostage thousands of people detained
during the suffering that it took three days ago and which shocked the world were killed more than 330 people, more than half of whom were children
we have gone into beslanu to seek some of the victims of that during the atrocities in school escaped death
exactly 10 years after the terrible the school in beslanu, which killed 334 people, including children, 186 warned yesterday evening surviving heroes before a new apokalypsou on ukrajině.
when 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new school year, capturing and murdered fanatical terrorists children and parents, this seemed like a deep seabed hell.

what is the greatest wish?
that war, which now destroying ukrajinu - and in which children as they die - has now ended.

after a few operations thought that is already fully being treated, but yesterday said: “three months ago, the pain would return.
I am afraid that I will have to further operation.
I remain in very archeologists today find pieces.
its aim is to become zubařkou, in order to help people as doctors to help it.
“this tragedy has changed me life, but it definitely clubs, ” said firmly.
“just happened to me, and it cannot be changed.
once a year I have been attending the Center, to remind those who stayed there.
otherwise, we are trying to do with friends not to talk about this.

I am thinking of the family.
it says that the grip of each year, but we have not forgotten memories slightly pale.
I am pleased that so many people around the world are still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the support that we have received from británie and from other countries.
when, on the Internet, as I look at its own photo lezu school window, I wonder, that many people see for the first time, they will understand the disaster, and prevent a repeat.
a boy who escaped rain bullets and believed that his mother is dead
this was the first day of school (in rusku children school starting in seven years) and survived three-day the siege of schools in embrace his mother tamary.
at that time, the seven-year said: “mamka told me that if a explosion, I have to lie down to earth and keep it as hand. ”
after the explosion of thought that the mother dies.
she told him: “utíkej. ”
that is totally dead, fleeing and path saw plačící toddler, grabbed her child in hand and utíkali sprškou bullets.
his father vladimir that there were caught, said: “damir told me that his mother is dead. ”
the: “I could not be saved. ”
in fact, the tamara dopotácela on freedom and lay in hospital zraněnou feet and thought that her son died.
once again met, said: “I plakala happiness.
I could not believe.
přiběhl inward and he hugged me.
damir then flew to londýna (according to the defunct newspaper news of the world), which was then prime minister tonnes blairem and his wife cherie declared winner bernardo 'with children.
“the horror of every day back, but I wish to that could stop thinking, ” he said yesterday.
I can say, though, that the memory is receding.
), then I immediately threw all their pistol on gambling.
but today I can play computer games, in which the shooting, and I have no problem with it.
“I am not afraid to go back to the Center, but I do not think for themselves.
I remember the children, with whom I have played in the yard and which are not out.
do we never say that they were killed or died.
we say that remain in the gym.
the trip to londýna), well, mainly on this, as I am in there could select anything I wanted, and as I went kabrioletem.
but now concerned about jobs as ukrajina where, because of the war is suffering as suffered he and his friends.
the horror of every day back, but I would like to think that could stop
“I am a terrible history of everyone who has such a horror must go through, ” says damir that last week in voluntary activity in the monastery.
I want a terrible history of power to help.
once again I want to work for the police, and I hope that the next year will take in the College.
his mother tamara, 48, says: “killed 37 children in our neighbourhood, can you imagine?
) to silence after attack. there were no children, which would have křičely and běhaly, silence lasted several months.
live remembers the way with damirem into londýna.
when I told our story in londýně, people plakali.
then I realised how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how can express its support.
it was grateful cherie blairové and its foundation for granted to price, and for the opportunity to go in autumn 2004 into londýna.
I wish you to cherie call and I say that, even though it has been ten years, still), at a meeting with her and her husband in londýně and both me and damirovi help.
I remember how should damir appetite for borsht, and so obvolali all of Russia ’ s restaurant.
also,), as in the restaurant played with číšníky, damir it fired from water pistol on them and they utíkali and played with him.
and this was only a month since the horror.
I was surprised, as with us britové wanted to share our pain and supported us.
she said: “I still think that the world is for those ten years has not changed for the better.
now it is the war on ukrajině, people are dying every day, and I think that has been, and will be killed, and a lot of children.
these are the same as those of our children.
I think that, for many people war is just something in the reports that have poslechnou when nudí or while doing something else.
I know that those people are living, as it is for terror.
it still feel.
nothing has changed, people are still want to kill each other, it is sad.
damir grew up and nice and quiet boy, it is not at all an aggressive or vzteklý.
for example, they have no desire for vengeance, that it is not at all.
I know that she is not a lot, but close to the six classmates and from time to time, go to gyms and zapalují there candles.
when he was smaller, with the problems - I remember how sometimes lehl on the couch with obličejem reversed--to re-open from us and sometimes so was lying hours.
nespal should open the eyes.
also,) that himself all their pistol or other weapons to playing. damirovi is today, is higher than I, nice, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I am a few hours was sure that is dead and that he never see.
when I have emerged after the explosion and put it on its feet, and I looked around and often this hell, they were pieces of human body.
was I am absolutely certain that my baby boy should this hell a chance of survival.
“), I am shouting ‘ damire, utíkej, utíkej! ', but I was convinced that I have not heard.
but I have heard it and fled.
so our lives is unlike other further.
grigorij ilyin, 17
a boy whose taken photo after attack has become a symbol of horrors in beslanu
consolation: the surviving from beslanu grigorij ilyin to his mother fatimou after the attack in 2004, the right grigorij today

how is this date approaches, it is still difficult to think and talk.
not a single one day to the tragedy nevzpomínali.
it does not seem to us that this has been a long time ago, I have the feeling that this was yesterday, some moments I still returns.
slibuju that no one will never forget.
still recurring memories: photo grigorije (left) was one of the most shocking images of attack and was zvěčněna as the statue (right)
I remember how the day grigorij sounds looked forward to school, he said that he wants to send a loving embrace its.
that is, I am keen to hear when I saw on television.
in travelling marinu is even the statue plačícího grigorije.
grigorij here not to dive looking at home and have it schovanou in knihovničce.
I can understand that, but I think that, thanks to the people around the world know what pain.
today grigorij says: "what is important is that this will not happen again.
“pochybuju that sometimes truth.
a similar tragedy is still right vyšetřují, but no one has ever will.
now the accident vyšetřují boeingu on ukrajině.
sometimes, we will know what was the reason?
the world is something very wrong.
“I do not understand why this is happening because, if you ask the people, so no one wants war, so how is this possible?
ten years is not for nothing that pain.
we at least a little forgotten needs for decades.
this has had an impact on my health, it still feel.
three or four years ago I had to attack the nightmare, but then it has improved.
when I then in 2004 back to school, every day, I was vyděšený.
I thought of their friends and performs, which killed.
therefore, when the 1 September, I have been attending gyms.
I want to pay tribute to the memory of friends from childhood.
it is difficult for me to join in the Center, but I have.
I am not a victim, the story is a thing of the past.
I will not forget this, but nelituju.
my life goes further.
this year I finish school and began to study Medicine at the University of vladikavkazu.
I want to be kardiochirurg.
first I wanted to enter into the army.
I wanted to be withdrawn, but because of health, I could not.
I am fighting for their country, but not this.
grogorij farniyev, 20
a boy who survived, even if we keep on foot vraždícího terrorists
a miracle: gregorij farniyev during the attack was held at the feet vraždícího terrorists, however, has been able to survive
when the attack in full swing, was received in the gym, sitting alongside bombs with vraždícího terrorists.
it is a miracle that survived.
"it seems to us that, as if it were yesterday, ” he said gregorij, who wanted to be a agent of the Federal Security services, but because of the injuries inflicted under attack.
still, it is with me, that is not something I threw away.
now I am older and says that children with bad experiences can cope better - I have to say that this is not true.
“in 2006 I walked to psychologovi and I was then a little better, but I cannot forget.
and I would like to forget.
in 2005 - a year later - this was the first and last time I came to gyms again.
omdlel I.
there has never been nepůjdu once again, please do not ask me please, to show you where to sit well known image.
the surviving: gregorij farniev today, on a laptop with their photographs pořízenou in hospital after attack
the pain is a huge and I have it with us every day.
my friends, I know that I am thinking or talking and never asked at a school asked this question.
as regards the physical health, I am in order.
we must be careful to their knee injury, which I think he has a, but already chodím normally.
but even so I could not take due to the health and study in the College fbs in petrohradu, as I wanted.
I sent them their documents, including medical reports and replied to me that that is not possible.
my other an inclination particular animals are, so I took on veterinu.
I have a second year dodělal there.
learn how to treat all animals from “cats after cows. ”
he said: “I know that their children will never be interpreted.
this is not something that children should know and not something that should experience.
his mother Resort, 42, said: “the pain will still be here.
it is within and worse, with the approaching anniversary of.
I will připomínkových ceremonií.
I know that it will not be grigorij.
it must be an even stronger for it because, unlike me.
I am waiting for it at home, and I could not help him.
I am grateful to the god so that it to me back in beslanu. here are everywhere.
remains with us.
gregorij is today adult, but the horror of carries on.
it is difficult to accept, if you will be something so terribly unjust.
it is a boy, likes to sport, but it cannot do it because of their very.
he had a number of operations, can go, but cannot practice.
I would say that, as of 50% of the awe overcome, but to overcome this completely and forget about it.
this terrible experience is still with us.
during the attack killed a lot of our friends and neighbours, and this pain only getting worse.
I have lost a lot of people I should like and who were close to me.
my son is with me, and that is the greatest gift that God could give me, but hurt me loss of those killed.
I know of the family, in which they were born other children, but also widows, which has again nevdaly.
it is difficult to accept that life goes further, even if you do not want.
I shall never forget how my heart jumped from nearly the thorax, when I have often in the hospital.
now pozoruju what is happening in the world - the war in other places.
what those people are fighting?
why were killing each other?
war is now coming to our country, which I can hardly believe.
in the past, we have one spřátelená country, as we have to fight together now?
people and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in ukrajině was and still is killed.
if we could all the rebels to and waste is - as far as it goes.

4 tips, as under water get better photos and videos
if you are interested in taking pictures or shooting under water, you have a large selection of equipment.
the cheapest option is compact such as nikon coolpix aw120 or outdoorová camera type gopro hero3 + silver edition, which is around $300.
these pictures I've on family celebration of a few foťáky, all cost less than $350.
it is one of the equipment, but in order to achieve the best results are a few rules.
double-check the equipment.
even if you have waterproof camera, make sure that the batteries and other sections are firmly closed.
furthermore, configure your camera, depending on the type of photos and videos you buy.
some cameras and video cameras everywhere have scenic or natáčecí regime that exposure optimizes the dark environment under water.
and you tackle this, to find out how far you its equipment immersed.
some cameras are intended to 5, further to 50 to 60.
please read our guide to buying and evaluation of the digital cameras in day-to-day and vodotěsném implementation.
I always a few images - a lot of them fail.
compact cameras are comfortable, which will help you to design photos, but do not have it period.
even if you are comfortable, under water will be wrong to see and composition scope will nepředvidatelná.
so we always do more images.
if the camera bracketingový regime that makes a series of images with slightly different dispersals exposure, take advantage of this.
keep is close to the levels.
with deeper equipment light significantly declined.
if it is possible to hold the photo shoot in the swimming pool, close to the lake or sea levels.
it also allows to capture the fotkách more light - the deeper potopíte, the less you colors.
bail, close to fotografovanému object.
this is an excellent Council if so on land, but under water is even more important because of tlumenějšímu light.
this is particularly important if natáčíte with outdoorovou camera: such facilities are usually a firm and wide angle lens, which means that if you want to fill fotorámeček, you need to points more.
andrew lawson was the one whose power figure was able to change things even in such a huge organisation as nhs.
as anesteziolog his career devoted to sick ulevoval from pain caused by diseases and treatment.
his wife remembers that one of the people who seek the assistance was officer mi6, who have to live with the consequences of torture, which it zmrzačilo.
lawson understood that, while the doctors focuses on the diagnosis and disease, léčené patients in the overwhelming majority of interested in a completely different: pain.
one day in 2007, however, it was he who began to suffer.
“I am not in your skin, ” he wrote in May this year.
I feel without energy.
dealt with symptoms of flu and found that is impatient and his wife juliet includes guilt.
note: “I want everything happening rather sooner rather than later. ”
in a week when juliet went on a business trip, lawson was unusually and inexplicably seemed upset.
something is not right.
my colleague, he has found the thorax.
one two weeks before lyžoval in French alpách.
were the results of the X-ray.
should mesotheliaoma, nevyléčitelný tumour, which affects pohrudnici nebo-li výstelku lungs.
for most cancers, it is difficult to determine what was their cause.
although some smokers are lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer, smoking.
mesotheliaoma is but another.
in almost all cases is the cause of exposure to asbestos - construction vláknitému material, which was previously described as “a miracle, ” but now knows that it is fatal.
for most of us was not difficult mesotheliaoma ignored.
asbestos, after all, belong to the past.
the most dangerous kind of asbestos in británii used since the 1960 ’ s, when the entry into force of the ban on the use of asbestos in the industry.
even at a time when the asbestos used with him in close contact came only certain groups of people, for example, pokladači stavbaři tesaři isolation, and workers in the shipyards.
toxin used in industry in another era now hardly seems to be a cause for concern.
such complacency but not on the ground.
as it turns out, in a británii today mezoteliomová epidemic.
the number of deaths on mesotheliaoma there is higher than in any other country in the world.
2 500 deaths per year for this disease is more than twice the number of victims of car accidents.
the number of deaths on the consequences of the mezoteliomu per year since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in a large británii
why only now being felt the effects, although it is using asbestos for years illegal (all kinds of asbestos was eventually prohibited by law in 1999) is that usually takes several decades than mesotheliaoma develop.
disaster in the form of mezoteliomu not not only veterans construction industry.
asbestos has been, and still is, in many cases, the present in homes, in which we live, offices, where we are working in schools, where we learn, and in shops, in which we are purchasing.
mesotheliaoma therefore does not respect the social layer of wealth, jobs or age.
privileged edifice from London commercial home after public schools are not shelter.
the Parliament is full of asbestos.
even the hospital, in which we should treat, are the disposal of this deadly carcinogen.
andrew lawson was old.
neither nepokládal isolation.
trying to find out where could come into contact with asbestos.
then on this.
"it is possible that a lot of asbestos in suterénních corridors like 'with comfortable beds, where I spent six years of practice, ” he wrote.
all - students, nurses and doctors and vrátní - call them.
the question is, how many of my family will receive the same disease?
unfortunately, this was the question, which was part of the answer.
“from the four doctors, who were in practice in the room with comfortable beds and which are then in the last five years has shown mesotheliaoma, ” said in a letter in 2010,“ I am the only still alive. ”
how many of us ill?
andrew lawson was with mezoteliomem diagnosed, when he was 48.
when 17 February of this year, he was 55.
to survive with this diagnosis as long as it is not business as usual.
55% of people diagnosed with mezoteliomem die in eight months since the diagnosis.
disease is always fatal.
now, therefore, we can only reiterate lawsonovu question: “how many of us is the same disease? ”
according to a prominent British expert on mesotheliaoma Professor juliana peta best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in británii, die around 90 000 people.
most of them are currently does not know that, in this way.
azbestový mine in quebecu, kanadě
when follows from an obvious consulting the writings of the archives of the courts, which has affected often turn and require a settlement, shows how much mezoteliomická disaster.
for example, the June admitted society marks & spencer that from negligence put asbestos janice allenovou.
nine years has worked for the chain, from 1978 to roku1987 when seen in two stores in the section of the jobs - one of the flagship of society, the trade in the West End.
allenové was only 18 when, for the began to work.
today, two children, which is more than 20.
“before it happened, ” he says,“ I am a mezoteliomu never before, I have rarely heard something to know about asbestos.
it never dreamed that I could somehow concern.
it is not the power of the people who know about asbestos.
in fact, there is no asbestos one substance, but the group of six minerals.
the name given due to its fibrózní structure, which gives it the power and ohebnost.
from the six minerals were used in the construction of three.
most often, is now in buildings can find chryzotil, commonly known as white asbestos.
it was used in the roof panels, floor tiles, bojlerových těsněních and even in brzdovém decor.
it is not a deadly as other forms of asbestos, aanwezig and who it yet as “a health risk, ” which can cause death.
but it is more dangerous brown asbestos (amosit) and blue asbestos (krokydolit).
británie was once the world's biggest importer of brown asbestos and experts argue that “there is a compelling, but an indirect evidence that this was the main reason for the unusually high incidence of mezoteliomu [in mixed UK]. ”
employees marsk & spencer asbestos was issued in the flagship store in the West End in londýně
janice allenová may be considered to be a victim of mezoteliomu, but the work juliana peta points out that its story is not unusual.
the study of patients, argues that, “a substantial part of the cases of mezoteliomu without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was probably caused by exposure to asbestos in environment. ”
a significant part of the exposition is caused by a “normal use and zvětráváním ” buildings.
it seems that no one could be sure that it is safe.
the report goddard consulting, which has been investigating the Westminster Palace, shows that even the people at the centre of governments may not suggests that may be subjected to asbestos.
in 2009, goddard report, according to which are the Staff mining and pipes for rooms of the parliamentary committee, the lethal contaminated asbestos fibres could be infringed something as benign as “strong stream of air. ”
ministers are often accused of that care only about their own interests, in this case, but it can be the opposite of the truth.
although the Directorate General services, Parliament insisted that the Westminster Palace was “positive medical certificates, ” is now agree that will need to be one million pounds, and several years of work that Parliament closely prohlédnut, updates, electricity and removing asbestos, and after the elections in 2015 Members would be rather than on the Green benches in westminsteru sit in the premises of the Centre of the Queen alžběty ii.
in the report goddardu costs that “the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with the rules. ”
it is not possible to say whether this discrepancy will cost lives.
everyone can now just wait.
one of the people who have never been able to determine when to exposure to asbestos is graham man, a doctor.
as well as andrew lawson has man (50) suspicion that was asbestos subjected to working in hospitals.
“I worked in the hospital, where it was proven presence of asbestos, ” he says,“ but in my case, that I cannot demonstrate.
it is difficult to remember all the places where worked, and when they worked.
clearly, but the day at the beginning of December 2009, when it zdolalo something like a fever.
he was 45, was the night and was in the middle of the operation.
at the same time I roztřásl.
this has come at once.
I was a terrible history.
I thought that nedojedu drive home.
as a doctor, knew that pain comes from pohrudnice, výstelky around the lungs.
but just as janice allenová have reason to believe that it is a mesotheliaoma.
at the end of the month spent at home.
confusion doctors have found him the thorax and introduced him hrudní katetr to remove him from lung tekutinu, which sent on analysis.
yet determine the diagnosis.
the situation is slowly improving and return to work.
from time to time, but the symptoms back, often after zacvičil and zadýchal.
in 2011, came to operating room one abbottových patients with similar symptoms, and then for it was diagnosed mesotheliaoma.
even then, however, man nothing tie their own case.
after all, the patient has been a few tens of years old and the work he came into direct contact with asbestos.
in this case, the link clear.
in September 2011 abbottův situation has worsened again and his doctor zkonzultoval his pictures from ct and X-ray with a panel of experts.
in December 2011, just two years after the man started to feel ill, he was in the area between výstelkou hrudní cavity and výstelkou lung introduced with the camera.
I am an optimist.
I have a tendency to take no power, ” says.
to be honest, I am with my concerns.
but rachel, my wife, worry.
the results of the biopsie reached between Christmas and a new year, "said to me that this is mesotheliaoma. ”
graham man: diagnosed with mezoteliomem
man has begun to meet the sisters of charitable organisations macmillan and one advise him to get in touch with a lawyer.
at the moment, realizing the epidemic.
“it turned out that asbestos was widely used, particularly in large public buildings, which are often azbestovou thermal insulation in the pipeline, ” says.
for people who have been exposed to in these buildings, are now beginning to disease.
mesotheliaoma has now beginning to apply to younger people, who have no risk profession.
the most dangerous tube heat-insulated asbestos in hospitals was in the basement, it is unlikely that threaten patients.
however, the members of staff, who suterénními removed went between buildings (as andrew lawson) or eat in suterénních dining halls (as often graham man) certainly come into contact with toxic substance.
as we are now shows were decades after the war hospital patients, a place where we can save lives, but also a place which could endanger the lives of doctors, who are treated.
asbestos is removing today.
they have bunsenův kahan built on azbestové Częste
and it is not just about hospitals.
asbestos is often used in offices, stores, libraries and municipalities, owing to its excellent izolačním and nehořlavým characteristics.
in schools.
in fact, many people are exposed to asbestos in school.
somewhere in the countless hours chemistry students were bunsenův kahan on azbestovou material.
arose Web sites dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools.
benign things like floor tiles or roofs shelter to tools in our homes normally contain asbestos.
"this is the industrial poison long time without a large number of houses, ” describing andrew morgan, a lawyer who represent andrewa lawsona in its action against the beds in the room.
in one case was the only contact with asbestos, on which a woman who mezoteliomem can remember, in the 1970 ’ s in breaking down open house.
so we pay attention to boříte garden house.
bearing in mind that the disease is incurable, is a huge impact diagnosis.
“takes time you will, ” says graham man.
I am back into work and tried to continue, but I found that we cannot focus on what I do.
the operating theatre, I was two weeks ago.
then I realized that I will have to leave and deal with himself.
well, other Christmas is nedožiju.
one of the most difficult thing was the transition from a doctor on the position of the patient.
as a myriad of patients from him and he remembers how felt confused in the amount of information that we have to tackle.
"it was difficult to do everything to understand, ” says.
“I asked his doctor:“ how much time left me? ”
I was told that the twelve months.
), as I have said: “no, other Christmas is nedožiju.
so it. ”
mesotheliaoma is particularly destructive, because the mechanism of what we kept alive - the respiration - is what causes cancer, which kills.
the majority of cases mezoteliomu is caused by exposure to asbestos.
asbestos fibres are small.
when the asbestos fibres, will breathe, they may reside in pohrudnici, výstelce lungs.
asbestos fibres pohrudnici, and may cause a mutation cells.
“problem are vdechnutá asbestos fibres jehliček-shaped, ” explains Professor this treasure, kardiochirurg, who in 2001, he was simply 'with comfortable beds.
in the same hospitals, where he was andrew lawson probably exposure to asbestos, and which is, paradoxically, the centre in the treatment of mezoteliomu.
treasure lawsona knows and an even more patients who were exposed to probably during the practice in the hospital.
jehličky asbestos in tissue treasure lung, says, “the respiration is pushing on the periphery, where it is výstelka.
nature is right from the beginning of invasive.
on mesotheliaoma routine treatment options used for other types of cancer, so do not work.
žhavě is under discussion, for example, about the effectiveness of the operation.
according to some would be worth trying.
treasure.
“cannot remove pohrudnici, ” says.
do not get around it scalpel.
cancer is “too to chemotherapy ” that has“ has an effect, ” but cure.
“sometimes there is someone who lung cancer will survive, ” says treasure.
but, in the end, everyone will die.
fortunately, some patients live far longer than expected.
author stephen jay gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
two and a half years since its own diagnosis graham man is still struggling.
after the findings of the man mezoteliomu contacted with andrew lawsonem which, four years after its diagnosis, individual support and Adviser for as disabled people.
when called, happily, presented: “hello dovolali you on the base of cancer. ”
“was a great deal of positive, ” says man.
the disease diagnosed him four years ago and was always very active.
at the beginning of the abbottovi offer six cycles of chemotherapy which lasted for four months, and is likely to live longer only a month.
“I was a desperate, ” says.
that is what I wanted to pay.
lawson but “has managed to show in optimističtějším light. ”
after a few doctors, man has decided to continue to treat with Professor loic lang-lazduskim of decoupling hrudní surgery in the hospital beds in the room.
“I had the advantage that I did not wait to send me to him, but I just there and they called me prohlídli ” admits graham.
normal patients would have to get žádanku and have had to pay for it.
in order to be able to get the best available treatment for patients with mezoteliomem question of money is crucial.
but when the different treatment, inevitably fail, many patients facing the next financial concerns - about the future of the family, which leave.
and therefore, turning to the courts and want to compensation.
andrew lawson contacted andrew morgana from the fisher waterhouse llp.
“since 1898 let it be known that asbestos is harmful to health, ” says morgan.
in the 1960 ’ s, but found that his very small amount may pose a risk to health.
and here we have negligence.
andrew lawson with comfortable beds and, finally, but according to the morgana not “full compensation, ” because lawson could not definitively demonstrate that mesotheliaoma was due to exposure to asbestos in the room comfortable beds.
after the investigation into the case, however, the members of the beds, confirmed that the “asbestos in inkriminované suterénní part was removed in the 1990 ’ s. ”
it was for andrewa lawsona too late.
how to remove the asbestos
exposure to asbestos fatal for one company or place of work - usually decades after happen - for patients with mezoteliomem seeking compensation has turned out to be a huge problem.
a lot of former workplaces changed owners or go bankrupt.
record safeguards are lost.
and those who are now accusations, are on their side, and that their prosecutors absolutely not.
in response to this fact was this year adopted an important new legislation, which is for patients with mezoteliomem easier to pursue compensation, even if it is not possible to their former employer untraceable.
the law has created a 350] the financial envelope are covered by insurance companies, which is intended to people diagnostikovaným after July 2012, who can prove that they were subjected to asbestos, but do not have anyone to court.
in that case, disability get 80% of the amount that would put them in a normal case, the Court gives as compensation - approximately 120 000 pounds.
every year is expected to 300 successfully vyřízených applications.
andrew morgan, as well as patients with mezoteliomem thinks that 350 million pounds is “good work. ”
"this is the agreement drafted insurance for insurance, ” says and points out that amount is a quarter of what would insurance companies have to pay, if allowed time and people with mezoteliomem would have been able to establish the former employer and the normal way is to prosecute them.
even mike penning, the former Minister of labour and social affairs, admitted that the law of the “should gaps. ”
but penning the morgan admit that, given the seven deaths every year it was necessary to rapid action.
the “people are suffering and need help immediately, ” he said penning in December last year, during the second reading of the law on mezoteliomu.
graham man was in the care of Professor loic lang-lazdunskiho 19 months.
after the initial consultations recommended lang-lazdunski operation, which, unlike tiene treasura thought that has a positive effect.
after the operation was followed by radiation treatments and chemotherapy - trojitá treatment for which lang-lazdunski can boast of the survival of the five years of up to 40% of patients.
abbotta reinforced.
"it is not, of course, the most important thing, ” says man.
patients that you still.
there is something you drives.
when without your situation could very quickly become.
graham man he had in March 2012 operation.
in late August completed last from six cycles of chemotherapy.
control checks not shown any the symptoms of the disease.
to further control I went in March [2014.
in the thorax I had several spills blocs] [cancer.
just to close my 50th birthday.
this is not a threat to life.
it takes.
man again took six cycles of chemotherapy.
at the moment, they are not in his body no trace of cancer.
but it is physically and emotionally gruelling process.
you need to think about the practical things - on financial collateral to die, or to show a woman, how does the alarm at the pot.
the bad news, you will be negative.
you need to look ahead.
as for the father ellie (16) and tamsin (14), it is not always easy.
"it is difficult for parents, ” says.
it is difficult to decide what to say and how much to say.
after diagnosis I holkám said that my situation means that I shall never old.
the response was different.
tamsin is a social and wild.
she said this friend and at the same time we started to call a lot of people.
ellie was more restrained.
the power of the said.
such talks must face up to all patients with cancer.
patients with mezoteliomem but such talks are odlehčeny hopes or just an indication of the chances of survival.
the disease brings with it (and eventually brought even stephenovi jay gouldovi) grim certainty.
as he says, “andrew morgan mesotheliaoma life does not compromise. ”

čína refusing to give hongkongu power to choose leadership - the promise of revenge
China ’ s parliament, despite proliferating discussions on democratic reform in the Sunday decided not to allow the electorate in hongkongu nominate candidates in the elections in 2017.
it is likely that this step will create long-promised protests in the business district hongkongu as activists have started to organise and prepare a few hours after the announcement.
China ’ s popular Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to exclude any candidate who is not loyal to pekingu.
“may surprise to us, but rozzuřilo us, ” said zákonodárkyně emily lau, Chair of the Democratic Party.
this is not what peking promised.
people in hongkongu lie.
and it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
in defence of China ’ s decision said the Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress if fei that allow public nomination in elections leadership hongkongu would cause “chaos. ”
since 1997, when británie back číně governance hongkongu, promises peking that starting in 2017 will be able to vote for the inhabitants of the executive.
China ’ s leaders present Sunday decision as a democratic breakthrough, because hongkongu allows direct voting decisions but also clearly demonstrates that the Chinese leaders remains firmly in the hands of the process of nominating committee which is strictly controlled pekingem.
and, according to the new clauses will přípustní only candidates who “love the country and 1. ”
the decision came after the summer months, which have been one of the largest and most reported protests in hongkongu for several years.
for the majority of pro-demokratických protests in hongkongu costs of occupation base with love and peace, whose organisers threatened by the financial district, if not peking universal suffrage.
on Sunday evening, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of occupation in the rain to collect a seat of government hongkongu.
to demonstrate the organisers have said that their movement is entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that, in the coming weeks, a wave of protests.
however, did not give any more details, obviously wanted to avoid the problems with the authorities.
in your Internet statements organizers said that “consider occupation base just as the final step in the event that they are used up all the possibilities for dialogue and have no other choice.
we regret that, today, all the possibilities for dialogue exhausted and the base is inevitable.
the authorities in the announcement hongkongu pekingu whole days prepare and on Sunday to strengthen the protection of governments and deployed police and the barricades.
encouraging the unrest in many residents hongkongu sign that slowly lose control of the city.
the influx of people from mainland increases competition in the area of products and services.
there is also a growing concerns that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are mounting pressure from pekingu bent.
some people criticise the occupation of the base and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - rescue vessel hongkongu.
“protest, which speaks, could lead to a much greater economic damage, depending on how many people will be attended by and for how long, ” says politician regina password, which criticises movement in the long term.
we do not want to spread fears that 1 is getting out of control.
such a perception would damage the investment.
the Chinese state-owned media in recent days, to come up with the reports that democratic activists in hongkongu portrayed as subversive agents managed by the West.
in the summer of activists, informal referendum on voting rights to which came 780 000 participants - more than one-fifth of voters in hongkongu.

American traditions pervades university life - prváci can lítat with plane
we are pleased that we can respond to the demand by launching a first class travel for students in británii.
for the purpose of zanechání best impression at check-in at the University of society also offers the possibility of transport, including private jets or vehicles type rolls-royce phantom, aston martin or mclaren p1.
stewart also said that the Service has a security dimension.
service is an ideal opportunity for students who would otherwise have had their things drag through the state in dangerously naloženém car.
we look forward with our vif (very important fresher - very important prvák) variants this year, we will ensure that the university students arrive with minimum nervousness and the luxury.
the company said that, given that the services have triggered, do not have any reservation, but added: “students will begin to book in the next few weeks. ”
the company also said that, while students pay an annual fees of 9 000 pounds, expects service on the market will find their place.
in comparison with the students 10, 20 or 30 or 40 years ago are today ’ s students others, with regard to the expectations and desire - is more important than ever to do good first impression and programme vif is exactly the right way to do this.
the National Union of students but service criticised as an unattainable.
megan dunnová, Vice Chair Janet Union for higher education, said: “for the majority of students is such a project.
a lot of students, who this month, on the university, must before throw thousands of pounds for something as simple as arrive on the sidelines, to deal with the financial crisis, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising cost of basic needs.
feminists, after the events in fergusonu oppose racism and police behaviour
at the beginning of the month, a policeman in fergusonu in non-militarised warrior hector young man.
here waiting at the funeral with hands up are chanting: “hands up, nestřílejte! ”
two weeks after the protests in fergusonu in warrior hector because of the shooting of non-militarised young man michaela browna, blogger miriam zoila perézová shift in the discussions white feminists.
found that when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and equality of income, a white feminists gender, race.
the increased tension in the West, which attracted the attention of the national press, perézová noted that response white women in 100% focuses on race.
in comparison with the reactions černošek soon after the killing of 9 August, personal articles with titles like “reflection working over fergusonem ” or“ feminism is not only about the oppression of women ” appeared relatively late in the day.
according to the perézové but this represents an important change.
“I think in feministickém movement is the power of the people who would on race and privileges spoke at such a level, ” said.
people feel that what has happened must express.
for the crisis that we are facing, it is characterised by because [situation in fergusonu] is so racially vyhraněná that it had to draw attention.
according to the professors English on state university in ohiu korithy mitchellové ferguson brought to light the problems that afroameričanky must face every day, in the cultural sphere is not seen as a “women's issues. ”
“I can to facebooku publish funny story of life with your partner and receive a 150 liků from people from all over the world, ” said mitchellová.
when I will write something that barevní are in their own country in the trap is deafening silence.
“how is it possible that a woman can talk about relations, but not on the safety of the public space? ” asked.
as for černošky mitchellová that deal with the issue of race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between the issues of race and gender.
černošky could not afford the luxury of a these problems: every day to live in this mixed reality.
even today, the issue of working race and gender in mainstreamových feminist circles merge, angela hatteryová, Professor lecturer female issue and gender studies on george mason university, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
between 1865 and 1890 was at least 10 000 blacks lynčováno and reason was in almost all cases of rape working, ” said hatteryová.
to justify the lynching you need cooperation white women.
according to the hatteryové schism between the white women and černoškami came when voting rights campaigner as susan b. anthonyová examined at the end of the 19th century terrain and realized that the electoral law can have only one group of people - women or blacks.
“decided to bet on voting rights for women, and on the right for blacks focus later, ” explained hatteryová.
if we do this, we will have an important insight on why color women white women do not really believe.
we have not done a good job.
we never černoškám help protect their husbands and children.
even after the women in 1920 gained the right to vote, it took ten years before they began to organize against lynching in Southern women Association for the prevention of lynching.
the group was 40 years after the first černošky said on aid.
according to the mitchellové white feminists in response to the questions that events in fergusonu brought - the issue of police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists have “catching ” issues which černošky those generations.
“it would be great if women in these areas [traditional feminism] take the right to raise the child as seriously as to take the right to contraception? ” raised mitchellová.
the second wave of feminists, who have done a career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraception, now find what it means.
significant feminist activist as gloria steinemová taken two weeks after the shooting michaela browna attack facebook, where published just rebeccy carrollové from guardianu which dožadovala for white američané forcefully protest against racism.
“I hope that women who have different, but similar reasons for understanding of risk in society - and views on race in opinion polls markedly different - will seek to change, ” wrote steinemová.
although the steinemová intersekcionální feminism, which includes the issues of race, sex, its comments on the question of race in americe some confusing.
professionals from cleaner enterprise institute wwe smackdown sommersová, author of “who stole feminism? ”, said to the efficiency of the young men in the United States, especially young barevní men, are“ much more vulnerable than their sisters, ” but comments steinemové parties fergusonu face criticism that has previously.
we now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost no for boys.
but when the White House launched a program we brother's january, which should help vulnerable young blacks and hispáncům was for many feminists including glorie steinemové a resentful response.
the relationship between the police to black community is not the only problem, which is coming to the fore mainstreamového feminism.
after the US border police arrested this year in the south-west of the country almost 63 000 minors unaccompanied minors, once again raised the issue of the reform of the immigration laws - this time as a women's issue.
andrea mercadová, joint chair of the smallest, organisation of mobilising women for reform of the immigration laws, said that, in order to raise the question as for women, the only thing to do is to share stories of immigrant women.
“speak for themselves, ” says mercadová.
given that most of the authorisation of grants the men, women, with them, that they are in a position where they are vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
“these stories have in women's organisations feedback, ” said.

what exactly happened?
it was a flaw in the material.
the car was a completely new, so I did not that something like this can happen.
this was not those provisionally correct and continue at a slower pace in the service, where it mechanics exchange?
if they go straight, yes.
but we still have to wait another two erzety and that it was not.
is it a high temperatures and the risk that the car began to burn, was great.
it cannot afford.
at full speed you manage five speed tests.
what you have had the impression from them?
very good.
I feel like young Karl-Heinz.
we have been quick, but I did through vint.
everything was caused by car we piplali more than half a year to be at any level.
race has shown that, we succeeded.
you have travelled it so that you can actually be considering victory.
the car I prepared so that we really have to win.
the work was not in vain.
on the other hand, the outcome of which we can think, arriving.
but this is barumka.
the technique, unfortunately, said no.
you have not been one of the leaders who resigned from the early on.
vypadli from him and foreign favoriti breen, abbring or lappi.
you surprised that so many favoritů project?
yes.
mainly for the audience that was a shame, because the race by ended prematurely.
at the top of the long varied and jaromír tarabus, whom you.
but who paid for that float on track and has almost a two-minute shortfall.
as you have been satisfied with his performance?
it is a pity, because it can repeat the podium.
after all, zajížděl first other times.

the agreement with the employer may be a problem
unfortunately, you have to give a confirmation of the default, which serves as a proof for the organisation that you cannot for health reasons to perform the duties.
moreover, the absence of you immediately made known employers.
consequently, although there has been an agreement that the days will be recorded as leave, but there was only verbally.
although the Labour Code imposes an obligation to keep in writing to confirm the consent of the employer in the drawdown of leave, in practice, this procedure has proved its worth.
if only to an agreement, you do not have an agreement confirmation.
later may be the alleged consent to the drawdown of leave, as well as in your case, which would contravene and absence at work viewed as a long-term neomluvená absence, hence the reason for the immediate abolition of employment in § 53 Labour Code.
in the case of judicial dispute about the agreement with the employer you so lacking demonstrable evidence.
working with you, but has not been abolished in § 53, only you are the days set out in the absence of a zápočtovém neomluvenou.
in the absence of neomluvená zápočtovém does not have the same effects as § 53 (such as the refusal to receive material security in unemployment), it is nevertheless the difficulties the possibility of finding a new job.
we recommend you to visit the doctor and have in writing confirm that there has been an injury, as a result of which you have been incapable of work (this is not about the so-called 'neschopenku', it is only about the document doctors).
in finding a new job you to explain this document and the situation.
in practice, it is advisable not to underestimate the exposure of written medical confirmation of sick and near the announcement of employers or request a written consent from the uptake of leave.
the mass, so any complications.

this weekend and decided to return to this needed to win the race in either atlantě or the plant in richmondu that pushed on the table.
to compete returned during the investigation into the tragic accident, who died 20-year-old kevin ward jr. that stewartovi entered in the race in the way.
the authorities have said that the examination of the causes of the accident will take at least two weeks ago.
so far, should not be decided on whether it will be stewart face some accusations.
the triple champion, before the event a warm, encouraging.
stewart began at the 12th place at the beginning of the propracoval on 10 and then even at 4.
then, at the beginning of the 122. buschovo car.
18 got out of control, set out from the other zatáčky and into stewartova, thus both cars sent to reimbursement.
stewart continued but withdraw on 21 place.
praha a new maintainer habitats taxi, earns 12.3 million
praha completed the procedure for a new maintainer habitats taxis.
for 103 parking Stallen receives annually roughly 12.3 million.
recently, at the same time, for the same jobs for the taxi driver cars per year chose 150 000 CZK.
inform councillors lukáš manhart (top 09).
before the city in the selection of using a lottery.
the winner gained the rent for lump sum 1000 CZK per year.
however, the rules have changed.
at the moment is the supply.
"a year since the expulsion of the original lease and opening of tenders have demonstrated that a new system for the rental is far better and, overall, fairer," says councillors.
it is the most expensive flek perštýně
the highest price offer candidates for the post in the street at perštýně.
pays 2.1 million per year.
approximately 1.5 million new jobs to pay for a obecním house or václavském Square.
the new rules lettings habitats taxis councillors adopted in autumn in 2012 and in the summer of last year, renounce the original lease contract.
the procedure was held in four waves and a new maintainer found 29 habitats.
for the second time this year we had to clean up studnu.
the whole we always deleted, thus aiming virtually the second pond around the hut.
then we have pumped savo there.
incredible puch!
our Well in a cellar was given to be always enough wonderful fragrant water.
and it was not terribly expertly done, Grandpapa it vydlabal independently.
a long time ago.
the only way to three skruže and overall svérázná, as indeed, all the cottage, but as I say.
the water was excellent.
to become.
when we started with the season, we have, of course, water.
when there were a number of months, deserved it.
but even then, it seemed to us that the water somehow nevoní.
it occurred to us, if there is something did not just fall.
where away with pumps, with bad luck, where the motherboard quite nedoléhala, so was the utěsněný a piece of bricks.
our inspections confirmed that the brick hýbalo.
otherwise, in the water was nothing, and we see it prosvítili up on the seabed.
so we once again the and přečistili.
of course, we have improved improvised seals around pipes pumps.
in the basement, we noticed but divných things.
the country was lying ulepený package with some kostičkami.
so it seemed.
and a step further.
now it looked like oslintaná mouse.
the ceiling, in places where they are průduchy, dědův invention, were the remnants of the fish!
and hard jeté!
our cellar is peculiar.
some would say that Grandpapa simply podhrabal chat.
and would not have been so far from the truth.
the walls and floor is only udusaný sand, only the ceiling is podbitý.
they are mainly ships.
and round.
and offers deck chairs on the beach.
gates with vast gaps have been most open as there in one someone walked.
in the ceiling for these vents.
without the network, so there are routinely zalétávají birds and trámech, puts the nest.
the mice, it is unnecessary to.
Grandpapa wanted it to luftovalo, and this it again.
now, however, neither luft help.
the cellar páchnul.
we therefore also clear the cellar.
particularly the fish to trámu was výživná!
we also threw out things were around :-board, heraklitovou album and so.
our hut in welcoming passerby dezinfekčním odérem.
we think, who are there to those of odious natahat?
the cat live two kilometres away in the village.
it would be difficult to us attended svačit.
dědu attacked a neighbour, which is completely in order.
whether on the franta are those nechutnosti there nešoupnul průduchem?
there is virtually throughout the year, blbý ideas, that he has.
we have chosen to cellar and studnu inspection and control.
after a few days, everything was fine.
we have again started to use water, not just for the washing of and money will be finished tests, but it was good.
pull water from forest studánky is not what I would like to do something for a long time.
once we have heard terrible distressing štěkot our feny.
Mommy look from balkónu and seen in the grass alongside the porch long strong black hose.
réza poskakovala pištěla over it and how crazy.
Mommy vynadala because it thought that réza vyhrabala waste hose of umyvadla.
at the same time, but the hose partly smotala into the network and partly has stood up.
heavily hiss on the balcony.
réza received hysterický Attack.
seběhli we down.
užovka, long a lot more than standard and all as býkovec, is going to swallow the enormous ropuchu and réza is hindered.
it was not clear whether I ropuchu save or whether it would devour a itself, but it was irrelevant.
when užovka přesilu (in the form of our entire families, some have said, whether it is sežereme when we have such hladi and elegantly with overran průduchem in the cellar.
they are for it.
like lightning ended up for studnu.
incidentally, we have seen on the motherboard further páchnoucí package.
according to the smell around rybka.
the day before yesterday there was not!
our new security around pumps was a bit šejdrem.
and we cellar zamykali even during the day.
that...
starting out and there we each at one průduchu.
we are waiting for a long time.
for wells that zašramotilo.
first appeared flat header the yellow TV.
then has swung to studnu whole užovka.
omotala around pumps and began to conquer inward.
the employee is vyhozený mstil, bought and sold them on the company laptops
after the release of zhrzený employee bought on the computer, and then it is sold.
this money has befallen before the detention police to spend.
in the short time he bought in the 12 cases, a total of 16 computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"laptops after taking odvážel into olomouce, where the sale bazaars," said the High Commissioner šumperské police rostislav brückner.
the motive of fraud was revenge employers for release and also gain money.
"when questioning are claiming that money is used to say, 'brückner.
the police also found that crook is patologický player who has repeatedly an to psychiatry.
the money that could end up in'inside customer appliances or in videoloterijních terminals.
"the fact is that we have not found any money for him, 'the Commissioner said.
podvodníkovi, which was already being punished for theft, now threatens to stay in prison for a period of one year to five years.
the police have tell whether a punishment also bazarům that laptops under the price is bought and sold.
"it is true that took over a completely new goods, which is at least suspects," said the Commissioner.
none of the owners of the bazaar, however, has not yet been accused.
still, it places a chill - as I enjoyed the star award
this year, the organisers have prepared several changes.
the greatest was change routes, which led the náplavku, rather than leading to yellow spa.
I enjoyed the race, along with the rest of the rungo.cz team, I was about to him but experience a little from the other side.
with the entire team, we have decided to personally zdravit our readers to stand, where we have jointly later than next and natáčeli videos.
to my view from the other side dotáhl to perfection, I took the role of personal wires.
along with kamarádkou káťou we just before the start of the obediently placed at the end of the corridor 60-70 minutes.
with we have with friends around us, who were in the sector for faster runners.
it had much time.
a few poskoků on rozehřátí, enabled sporttestery, countdown and start!
cries of elation, but instead of fast-start followed cupitání to the starting line.
after five minutes we come to the gate, all measuring and rozbíháme the pace of the hour ten.
it features proplétáme hadem runners who, like káťa runs its first race.
so far, all the lush, gradually declining the sun in the sky gives perspective vyšehrad almost all kýčovitý connotation.
a vibrant meat stretching after the looks as if we ran a praha.
on the very waterfront between vyšehradem and national theatre traditionally starting to see who is how many forces.
easy kopeček on palackého square forcing many runners slow down or to move to walk.
just before I see přeběhem in police escort and it flies vítek pavlišta incredible rate in the objectives.
I hear obdivné ufuněné vzdychání other runners.
I shall move on the edge of the track, encourage him to me plácnout, but just before I podvrtne leg and our hand with just a mine.
seběh theater street gives the opportunity for a short break and rozdýchání.
it is necessary, there are points on which I views vyrazí breath.
pivot to bridge the threshold mánesově shows in the beauty of the setting sun.
nedýchám and feet me is hardly alone.
for the first občerstvovačkou is the moment of truth.
when přeběhu roads káťa škobrtne on obrubník and displays leap plavmo.
I am looking at whether does not need assistance and spouštím a series of encouraging words that had time to think about the pain.
lifts and continuing goat alley, this is one of the nejužších jobs at this stage race track, there is not a flood of, but it must be well monitored.
even netuším that the concept of inner instead gets its true meaning later.
for prašnou gateway us freneticky encourage tourists and kamarádí other runners.
I am trying to tlesknout, with everyone who will hand, and I also kátě because ten tlesknutí with fans is as if energy bars.
the fact that works, and even if we have once again zrychlujeme quite well being, now begin purchasing ride.
předbíháme dozens of runners when míjím someone particularly a worn-out, I try to encourage a few words: 'places, even a short, chill!'
for the last občerstvovačkou us no longer nepředbíhá, zrychlujeme.
so far, We per hour and a quarter, we are adding, is not to wait.
three kilometres to the targets will hurt, but we need to really máknout.
only the sun has been slow and difficult day symbolically slowly puts an end to the race.
the last climbing pivot to the bridge, and only stretch to objectives.
the pace at which we run, I am struck by the fact that in děvčeti takes?
"places, we are under an hour 13, makáme! 'call.
we have tried, sprintujeme and there are objective.
the 13 and six seconds.
well, what can be done.
coach commissioned limit hour 20.
so the seven minutes under the plan.
which is super outcome.
just as the aim of the kátě podlamují feet, her to), where the moment to rest.
it is up to them to see the exhaustion, but also the happiness of well odvedeného performance.
after the moment it slowly odvádím out of the area.
the euphoria does not give us think about the crowding various displays in the passageways to šatnám.
here we can see that the goat impasse was not the strictest place.
it is only here in order to náplavka, which is under the strain of the almost ten thousand runners nacpaná to the breaking point.
if someone does not like crowds, this is not the place for it.
I, too, for the moment, lost its head, and I wonder whether the beautiful views and compared to previous years more interesting route, for what is happening in the end.
I know from experience that the organisation of the race is no fun.
if one adds to this ten thousand people, rich accompanying programme and the closure of the thresholds for all transport, it is a huge challenge.
this change route has shown běžcům many interesting places, but also produced a few very unpleasant surprises.
the excellent atmosphere rozpumpovaná in yellow spa became between the runners in the race.
the organisers náhodní viewers around the track and increasing it on any metro line.
in the city ’ s historic centre, unfortunately, must reckon with obstacles, which cannot be eliminated, but the goal of mass factory in place that is, on the one hand, ohraničeno walls and on the other the river, do not find the best solution.
if you say that the race ended proběhnutím objective, I regard it as very nice.
in order to have a bit worried about the health of those involved, but in the end all was well.
please contact us to debate whether you route liked and what you say to the situation in the end.
prison guards in bulharsku organise protests
hundreds of workers prison services throughout the bulharsku participated in popular protest rally to the Ministry of justice in the capital of sofii.
the peaceful demonstration reiterated its call for the reintroduction of the original working conditions, which in recent times have changed.
on the list of requirements to be discussed with the provisional Minister of Justice hristo ivanovem are even higher wages.
guards month symbolically protest against the new working time and to call for a return to the original 20 čtyřhodinovým shifts.
although the trade unions prison detached and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, not agreed to inform the Bulgarian public radio (bnr).
“negotiations are still ongoing, ” he said bnr leading directorate-general prison services rosen zhelyazkov.
it is expected that the protests of workers prison services will also members of the Federation of trade union organisations of the Ministry of the Interior.
why can have space more proportions, and we are not
physics usually do best, but brianu greenovi from the Colombian universities in 1999 out to succeed.
his book elegant space has become accessible to the whole way to reach houštině problems today deals with many of the theoretical physicists gathered - uniting two well-functioning, but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and general theory of relativity.
one of the causes of the success of the elegant space is undoubtedly that, in the case of finding a united physical theory is not about boring story.
physics fundamental problem between two key theories (after all, at this moment is our space de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) address and to tackle the imagination, that it is worth převyprávění 32.
moreover, a complex dossier greene advise so lush and engaging that he cannot be blamed for many interesting did not include in their books.
moreover, its' wrong 'largely rectified in the other two books: the structure of the space and hidden reality.
nothing would probably not the author objected to this, if his book zastarávala faster, but the fact is that, even after 15 years of the universe is still almost everything substantial, what would an informed with ambition of the world should know about this important part of the theoretical physics.
it is quite likely that in the coming years will be in this area, only a little more vigorously (to be due to the fact that urychlovač lhc is finally on the 'full gas'), and this is a good moment to enter greenem peacefully open the doors of the modern world.
how many dimensions may have our space?
the idea that our space, perhaps more than three spatial dimensions, you can read foolishly, provides, strangely or mysticky.
yet it is specific and completely acceptable.
we understand that, at the moment, odvraťme its eyes from space as a whole to something přízemnějšímu, namely the long, thin garden hose to irrigate.
imagine that stometrovou garden hose to boot from one side canyon, on the other, and the whole scenery watching from půlkilometrové distance (as in the image and on the following page).
from a distance to a new direction in vodorovném hose, but only if it is netrpíte bystrozrakostí, the width of rozeznáte hardly.
given their large distance of you would think that mravenec donucený live on hose has only one dimension, which could go through: levo-pravý dimension along.
if someone asks, where he was mravenec at the moment, from just one figure: distances ants from the left (or the) the end.
all of this we want to say is that of půlkilometrové distance seems a long sleeves as a one-dimensional object.
in the real world of the width.
if all zvětšíme, we suddenly the second dimension - in the shape of the circle ovíjející hose.
in such zvětšeném perspective, it is clear that mravenec can actually move in two independent dimensions: in already well known levo-pravém dimension after length, but also in 'dimension in / against the direction of movement counterclockwise', i.e. around kruhovéhoprůřezu sleeves.
you understand that, to determine the position of a small mravenečka you enter the two figures: how far from the end of and where it is kružnici ovíjející hose.
this reflects the fact that the surface of the two-dimensional (note experts spot, that this chapter focuses solely on poruchovou theory strun.
neporuchové aspects raised 12 and 13 chapter.).
the surface of the two-dimensional: one long podélná dimension is znázorněna direct arrow, dimension in the direction of constituency, marked with circular arrow, it is short and svinutá.
between these two dimensions, however, is a clear difference.
dimension along sleeves is long and visible.
dimension ovíjející district of is short, 'svinutý' and less apparent.
we are aware of the existence of a dimension, we had to hose study with a significantly better definition.
this example illustrates an important feature in space dimension.
that is divided into two groups.
they can either be large, vast and therefore directly, or, on the contrary, small svinuté and much less observable.
of course, in this case, we have just nepředřeli to 'svinutou' dimension ovíjející width of exposed.
it will take to help dalekohled.
but if sleeves - as was thinner hair or kapilára - svinutou dimension we discovered only with great effort.
kaluza sent in 1919 einsteinovi your article in which he with stunning the idea that spatial geometry space can have more than three are known to all dimensions.
its radical kaluza ’ s claim that the additional dimension offers elegant and convincing framework in which can be einsteinovu general relativitu and maxwellovu elektromagnetickou theory vetkat into a single, united pojmové structures.
immediately, the question arises as to how far this kaluzův observation together with an obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of the area.
the answer that kaluza quietly assumed between the lines, which spoke out clearly and clarify the Swedish mathematician oskar за in 1926, stands or falls by claiming that spatial geometry of our space can be as large as well as svinuté dimensions.
this means that, as well as the dimension in the direction of sleeves is also our space large, vast and plain to see three dimensions, whose existence is every moment aware.
but, by analogy with kruhovým district garden hose may have space and additional dimension, coiled up tightly in the area and a modest that still remain hidden even before our nejdokonalejšími experimental aparaturami.
in order to get a clearer picture of the essence kaluzova remarkable proposal, let us stay even for a moment of sleeves.
imagine that, in the constituency of do we draw a black colour relatively close-knit a circle.
zdálky hose still looks like a one-dimensional line.
with the telescope now thanks to detect svinutou dimension in the drawing even more, we will see the motive of image 2.
clearly, we see that the surface of the two-dimensional, with one dimension with a large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
kaluza and за came up with the idea that our space is similar in structure, but in addition to the one small circular dimension has three major spatial dimension, together, čtyřiprostorovédimenze.
it is difficult to draw object with too many dimensions.
in order to help our imagination, a note on the obr.3; it shows the two large dimension and one small circular dimension.
on the picture zvětšujeme view of geometry area, just as we increase the surface.
each of the following level represents a huge increase in geometry area from the level of previous.
our space may have additional dimension (see is the fourth level enlarge), if they are sufficiently svinuty into a small area; that we make it clear that we still have not seen it directly.
čtvercová network through the commonly known 'great' dimension, while the circle with a new, malinkou and svinutou dimension.
just as the loop thread in densely utkaném carpets, and these circle exist in every corner of the usual dimensions - just because we are názornosti zakreslili only until you turn in lined network.
the background image 4 shows commonly known structure area - a world around us - in such ordinary měřítkách, such as meters, znázorněných party in a small čtverečku lined network.
on each of the following screenshot focusing on a small area of the image of the previous; zvětšíme it to become visible.
initially, nothing is a special case, as we can see in the first few levels increase.
however, when we move on its path for the microscopic properties geometry area on - the fourth level of increasing the 3 - we suddenly a new, in the shape of the circle svinutou dimension, a similar smyčkám thread in densely tkaném piece carpets.
kaluza and за came up with the idea that there is an additional circular dimension to any place in the direction of large dimension, as is also of traffic circuit at any point in its duration.
in the interests of názornosti we circular dimension zakreslili only in some, regularly deployed points.
the picture 4 kaluzovu and kleinovu idea of microscopic summarises the geometry of the area.
the similarity with hose is clear, even though we are also important differences.
firstly, space has three major, far rozléhající spatial dimensions (of which we nakreslili only two), whereas sleeves has great dimension only one.
even more important difference lies in the fact that we are now talking about spatial geometry space itself, not just on any subject within the space, to be our hose.
the basic idea is the same.
if it is an additional kruhově svinutá dimension of the extremely miniature, recognise it is - as well as the traffic constituency sleeves - much harder than to observe the obvious large and vast dimensions.
the size of the additional dimension je-li small enough, it will, in fact, on the strength of our modern instruments to promote.
the most important thing, however, is that the additional dimension is not a mere oblým hrbolkem within the normal dimensions, as dvojrozměrná illustration mistakenly indicated.
circular dimension is a new dimension which exists in any point three current large proportions.
it is a dimension of the remaining three dimensions independent as well, such as dimensions shora-dolů, zleva-vpravo and zepředu-dozadu independent (and kolmé).
sufficiently small mraveneček could move in all four dimensions, and to define its position we need four data, in addition to the three of the usual even position in circular dimension; počítáme-li and time, then data five, in any case, one more than we would normally have expected.

book elegant space briana greeena you can buy here on knihy.idnes.cz.
the price for e-knihu is 149, - kč.
to our surprise, therefore, we can see that, although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions, and shows kaluzovo kleinovo thinking that this is not excluded the existence of additional svinutých proportions jsou-li sufficiently small.
space can be safely proportions, more than we can see the naked eye.
as a small should be?
the latest technical equipment can recognise the structure of the large miliardtinu miliardtiny standards.
smaller svinuté dimension can hardly be seen.
in 1926 approach за original kaluzův idea with a few ideas from the emerging quantum mechanics.
its calculations suggested that the additional circular dimension could have the size of the approximately one planckovy length, the size of the far beyond distinctive capacity of today ’ s devices.
since then, physicists call the possibility of additional small-scale kaluzovou-kleinovou theory.
wohnout honza homola advises exercising on electric guitar: 5 part
the substance of the '12' lies in dvanáctitaktové harmonious form, which can be repeated.
who tápe in musical theory finds its principle closely vysvětlený here.
jan homola or honza homolka capsule (1976)
education loutkař and loutkovodič facebookový profile, which can be seen here, from the Baccalaureate twenty years ago feeds as graphic designer.
it is their guitarist band wohnout from which the supposedly unfortunately cannot leave.
their guitarist is after his father, as well as a brother matěj, leader wohnoutů.
with trénováním start on one struně.
"rytmický model is the only you think you can anything, it then apply to the harmonious model-12, 'advises honza.
when you add another chord, you can turn unpleasantly man.
we only have to hear and see honzu, what can be with dvanáctkovou harmony on two strunách invent and how much it begins to read.
přiberete-li third chord, you can flirting with tunes some songs.
and finally, add a fourth, not to change tuning, highlights honza in the video.
the next honza return to pentatonice and you try it put together with Member States regarding.
so it honestly cvičte.
how best to you in an interview with janem homolou for the first lesson schools play on electric guitar here.
another goal without waiting?
the great that it recognises the hradecký dvořák
the point we are and we wish for it.
the first half, we have more chance we, the second domestic, 'of the aggressor, which this time have scored from the penalty kick.
you have not been in his zahrávání nervous, yet it was accompanied by massive pískot?
in particular I did not regard, while on the other the goal, where are the domestic fans, it would probably be worse.
penaltou you after půlhodině rise, but you goal also from touching received after less than four minutes.
what happened?
we are behind the beginning, we have been passive, arose from the Horn, and this then penalta.
after you have raised and the first half you have a better team, who have more chance.
why is this after the break changed?
it is hard to say.
I agree that we have to break inkasovaném gólu well.
in the cabin, we have said that we want to keep pace, even after the game, but we have not succeeded in this.
to be honest, nor do I cannot explain why.
but it is perhaps also true that are home to break something to their game said about it were very satisfied.
for the first time you have only a rival bodovali while at home you need not even goal.
why is it that the difference?
I would not say that this is such a difference, but rather it is up to us to tackle.
in brně we started well, but it is bad, plzeň from us, that is another category.
four games you have waited for the goal, you should not fear that, after the last match can be similar?
it or not, but, of course, we are pleased that since last match can talk of waiting for a goal to listen.
we are now without waiting added yet another, but they are still only three in six matches, which even on large that it is not.
island - láva kráteru wisdom of kilometres away.
láva vyletující on the surface in holuhraun near the iceberg vatnajökull underground tunnel, wisdom of kilometres away kráteru.
it is under hitting, as part of this underground lávového tunnel.
this fact now scientists concerned most...
the situation is constant.
since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still vyletuje from pukliny roughly the same amount of lávy.
compared to the original estimates, however, is its number of less than 1 000 m3, but 'only' 300-400 m3.
compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is only 50x greater.
scientists are, however, concerned that the lava tunnel could open up, even in places where there are under the ice.
if so, moreover, with a similar intensity, which displays the current eruption, this would mean huge floods, both on the river jökulsá á fjöllum and other rivers.
the eruption is to feel strong smell of sulphur, from the gaps are rising oblaka couples and emissions.
it is definitely not the eruption suitable for tourism, as it was in the case of the eruption of fimmvörðuháls in 2010.
this is much more, and there is also a much more gases, "says vulkanolog ármann höskuldsson.
however, the weather has significantly improved since yesterday, in the morning there was in the area of almost bezvětří.
traces of a storm were smyty rain.
scientists can continue their work.

exhibition per year in praze?
hall, vyprodala, planned rozlučku jágr

on such things are not forgotten.
it was against calgary flames and three young: I robert holík and robert reichel, we certainly in a troika.
for all this was the first representational start.
no but that we somehow dominated, so this is not to say.
in jihlavě after a long time chytal dominik hašek.
what you said on his performance?
I am hašan on ice never no surprise.
I wanted to return to the criticism, but I cannot (hašek criticised jágra for reasons why decided to end in representation) .zachytal simply excellently.

genetic disorders are often poorly diagnosed
a woman from británie describes how bad the diagnosis, after many years of thought that die.
after it was diagnosed with another disease, spent karin rodgersová most maturation in the belief that it is just a few years of life.
in fact, it was a charcot-marie-tooth syndrome (cmt) - the hereditary disorders, which damage nerves outside of the brain and the backbone of.
charities cmt uk said that bad diagnosis is between people with cmt a problem, because the disease is very little.
it is thought that in mixed UK suffer cmt approximately 23 000 people, which may be symptoms such as in the area of motoriky svalová weakness, nemotorná walk and twisted fingers on foot.
with the affected can occur also insensitivity or pain, this situation is neléčitelný and progressive, which means that over time, symptoms are getting worse.
when it was rodgersové 13, she thought suffer freidreichovou ataxií (not) - diseases, which is very bad prognosis.
believed that than will celebrate the 18th birthday, will be upoutaná on roller-seat, and dead than it is 30.
the mother of two children, which is now 51, says: “as a child, I know that I can do the same thing as the others.
every day I fell and all it took me.
I have never with other children cannot go on inline skates or skateboardu and in school, he was due to this, as I went and běhala. ”
when it was rodgersové 13 and, after a few operations, which should make its achillovy tendons and redress, take advantage of the fact that the doctor has left the room and nahlédla into its documentation, where to learn that are not.
“I felt guilty, because I am slídila, and so I have no one said, but when I returned home vyhledala I have information about the disease in the library and I have written to the Association fa, ” says.
when I answer, I was in shock, I completely panicked.
I had thought that, before me, I will be 18 in wheelchairs, and I will be 25, I will be dead, and, in the meantime, gradually ztratím all their skills.
I was on a completely itself and planned I am funeral. ”
when she was 17, its ability to walk the worse as much as envisaged, and ask it to its surgeon.
to put it simply, he hugged and said: “sweetheart, I do not think that the disease, otherwise you would have been in wheelchairs.
I think that this will be something much less life hazardous. ”
after graduating from several genetic tests that has cmt.
"when I explain what cmt is, I thought I was a child of fortune, ” said.
charities cmt uk launched a month awareness of cmt to draw attention to this disease.
entrepreneurs in the area of washingtonu: with a turnover of economies are raising their taxes
the growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
and higher taxes.
according to a new survey, which was published last week, state and local corporate taxation in the country to accelerate the recovery of the economy last year slightly increased and firms in washingtonu were the exception.
entrepreneurs in marylandu and virginii together for fiscal year 2013 to state and local treasuries have done 27,6 billion, which is to 3.8% higher than 26.6 billion dollars collected in 2012.
the tax burden - national and local - the last year has lifted by 4.3% to 672 billions of dollars in comparison with the 3.9% last year, and it was the third year in a row growth for 2009 and 2010, when the tax cut.
according to a study conducted by the professional company ernst & young and political groupings centres, he did so, state tax increase faster by 4.3% than local levy on 3.9%.
more than half of the tax revenue, 56% of business tax, and 36% of income marylandu is from companies.
virginia with 28%, is showing in proportion to the smallest tax revenues of business.
researchers argue that the majority of the growth of tax revenue comes from an increase in the value of properties belonging to the firms which property taxes this year for three consecutive years, with the growth of -1% increase by 3.7%.
although the majority of profit comes from the large states as kalifornie, and texas, it seems that the same is also washingtonu.
companies in d.c., marylandu and vriginii last year paid more than $10 billion to state and local taxes on real estate, compared to 9.6 billion in 2012 represents an annual increase of 4.2%.
a clear increase in the value of the real estate, however much nevyhání up national and local tax revenues in marylandu where property tax is less than one-fifth of taxation of companies.
for companies in virginii and d.c. represents a real estate almost half of the state and local taxation.
“in marylandu own a lot of real estate companies, in particular, the tax base in the vicinity of d.c., the government or non-commercial organisations that do not pay taxes, ” explained douglas lindholm, the executive director of the center so he did.
so maryland is forced to rely much more on, for example, of tax revenue to pay for the same services, which are in other countries.
the recent increase tax revenue from business cannot be připsáno only uzdravujícímu with the property market.
according to the data, it seems that the revenues from the business is also increasing.
firms in the region by the income tax commercial companies $2.3 billion, which has increased from 2.1 billion from 2012.
maryland on income tax commercial companies chose $1 billion, the most in the region.
although we were moving in the same direction, local tax burden on entrepreneurs is growing in these three places as quickly.
the rate of growth in d.c. was at the level of the national average, at a 4.3%, while growth marylandu was significantly higher 4.9%.
only in virginii was an increase in taxation below the average, 4.1%.
virginia has from all three circuits (all of which have the same taxation) the lowest income taxation of companies, 6%.
the rate of taxation of companies in marylandu is 8.25%, while the average d.c. remains relatively high, at 9,975%.
similar studies, which this year by America ’ s trade chamber, showed that virginia has reduced the state and local taxation and generally favourable tax climate than maryland.
d.c. study nehodnotila.
despite this advantage virginia pressure faced with competition from the south.
the northern karolína recently signed a law declining tax commercial companies from 6.9% to 6%, as well as virginia, and next year, a tax cut to 5%.
if the state in the coming year to meet the targets could be in 2017 law laid down the rate of taxation to reduce up to 3%.
according to a recent study by the small-scale entrepreneurs in washingtonu leads to better, and therefore pay higher state and local tax.
živnostenská tax payable by small-scale entrepreneurs as a personal income - the structure of the compensation for the increase in the cost of price increases, according to which it is organised most companies - in d.c., marylandu and virginii grew last year by 20% to 2.4 billion dollars, much faster than others.
researchers argue that trend and national business tax increases will probably next year to continue, the total tax revenues from the sale of state and local governments are compared with the same period last year, the first three quarters of 2014 will rise to 6.2%.
welcome may, however, for the other behind because reducing government spending is taking its toll on the labour market.

family joan riversové: “fingers crossed ”
joan riversová is unconscious three days, since it brought to the hospital in the way, but her daughter today to express that have not lost hope that jednaosmdesátiletá komička recover.
“thanks for your good wishes to, and support for, ” said melissa riversová in today's statement.
we are keeping my fingers crossed for it.
her mother brought to mount sinai beds on Thursday after call a service, according to which it has been heart stopped at yorkwillské endoskopii in upper part, as the source.
doctors it deliberately keep under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision, as long as they are not sure of its state of which is “a ”.
the response to the cooperates with top conductors and including the incredible support on the Internet from the figures as donald trump, montel williams and kelly ripa.
the reality is překrucovaná headlines
that the media with subtitles distort the reality is not (unfortunately) news.
I know that the 'sell' the newspaper headlines, but unfortunately, I also know that there are many so-called 'readers', nothing else nečtou.
and this is the fact that the last time, I am very worried about, the better it is rather the word pitting.
this applies especially to the articles on the conflict in Gaza and hamásu izraele gazy.
are commonplace headlines' izrael attacked gazu '.
only the text read that Israeli '' 'was a response to the burned rockets from Gaza gazy, often at the time announced a ceasefire.
this is, then, a title 'both parties have violated the cease-fire'.
editorial community realizes that its procedure directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that throughout evropě (and not only there) increase?
not even the 60 years since the end of World War II.
yet there are people who survived the Shoah.
when I saw the videos from the German Federal Republic, where the crowd screamed the slogan 'Jewish svině' and similar zhůvěřilosti, zatrnulo me.
it wants the world to finish what went wrong hitlerovi?
our journalists are aware of the fact that, after the Jews were destined for disposal slované?
ladies and gentlemen, please a little more care of their work.
often, you have termed 'guard dogs democracy'.
so it obhajujte.
as long as there is.
and obhajujte also right a truly democratic state in the East to protect its population.
as you would like to maintain our government, if one of our neighbours decided that the Czech nation and the Czech Republic will wipe off the map of the world?
perhaps you should also remember one fact.
in the territory of a Member State izrael live almost 20% arabů with Israeli citizenship.
and they are there.
when asked why they do not between '', to be the gazy, the answer you why they do that?
in izraeli have work, social security and high-quality health care (I myself to see how the top private hospitals hadassa, which is funded from the fundraising donations Jews from around the world, normally go and Arab and there are, of course, treated).
hamás its missiles attacks on its Arab brothers.
the only real assistance gaze and, hence, this troubled region, is to get rid of it hamásu and disarm it.
and not condemn izrael, albeit indirectly in the headlines.
inform about practices hamásu, on the abuse of people as human shields.
please note that hamás aims to destroy the State izrael at any price.
even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
inform about the fact that the world ’ s hamás is on the list of terrorist organisations.
please note that for nine years of self-government in this area could be gaze thriving thanks to the humanitarian aid from around the world.
even from izraele, water and electricity supplies, for which, of course, is not true gazy managers and even tempers are rising, that are sometimes in this time of mainstream interrupted.
if hamás has invested money in the construction of underground tunnels can penetrate suicide attackers on the territory of izraele, but to be in the construction of housing, hospitals and schools, lived its Arab brothers of gazy considerably better.
amazon buys for 1.04 billion dollars twitch
amazon has just confirmed the information on Monday morning: Internet maloobchodník - producer videos and hundreds of other things - buying for 1.04 billions of dollars (970 million U.S. dollars) video streamingovou service twitch.
the announcement of a surprise, not because no one would have expected twitch someone buying, but because it is expected that the buyer depending will youtube.
three months ago was selling twitche googlu for one billion, and this link appeared to be a natural.
twitch, which only three years ago, was a justin.tv primed to become widely used video streamingovou service - lively version youtube.
instead, it quickly became a platform for players who to it by transfers of online games - words business trading “youtube for live broadcast playing. ”
interaface twitche.
on youtube are already popular video “of play, ” a kind of where mudrlanti (mostly older), Games oil (of course.
the fact is that the youtube in popisutwitche comes to a lot, so the report that youtube kupujetwitch, no power nevzrušily, it was a textbook example of how the society pays possible competition.
a mystery is why an agreement with youtube did not work, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as amazon.
what we currently have at our disposal is expressing ceo twitche emmeta sheara: "we have chosen a amazon because they believe in our society, has the same values and a long-term vision and wants to help us deliver quickly. ”
another mystery is - quite frankly - incredible success twitche.
for snoby like me, who argue that sport rather than are doing, it is difficult to understand what is so wonderful, instead of playing the game only observe.
one thing is to look at three in the morning friend over the shoulders, as has originated evil, and quite another thing is to see someone foreign to receive 20 intervention in the heads of the call of trained.
all games, on which you have just could look.
another problem is that a lot of today ’ s, the most popular games are from the perspective of the players, so look at their record, without you could themselves perspective to control, it is quite a good formula to buy headaches.
I admit that the game of speed, in which rogeři bannisteři our electronic time to complete the game in record time, is fun.
but if someone is not master or humor, his channel on twitchi will probably not very interesting.
but what about the skeptics as I know?
twitch has a month 55 million visits and is a fourth on top of Internet users.
how, exactly, amazon use?
it is hard to imagine that the twitch vmíchá into amazon instant video, elegantly, as it might have swallow youtube.
twitch but is something that I would draw any company: crowds of young men, advertisers want.
as he said, the director of the twitche shear amazon, twitch “believe in the future of the games ” and media look that would be reluctant to, or as - polknutí - viewers.
the second basic lie Christianity.
another Czech translation of US ateistického vloggera arona requirement.
on the subject of 'holy fonts are the divine word'.
annexed the original video.
the second basic lies Christianity is the belief that the sacred texts have been written by God and not the actual human authors.
when the faithful debating one of the many things that are at odds with their religion, often us stand before the question: who will believe?
the alleged božímu word, or the word man?
as if the investigation was completely trivial in comparison with the authority that is that it is their doctrine.
yet, when they say 'you', talks about science.
and when reporting to the word ',' božímu reporting to the myths of God facing people.
if there is indeed a smart with tvořitel with a view to, then it is he who created the fossil record, which reveals the evolutionary history, and this must be the one who invented genetic patterns, which they are responsible, and it must be, add another series of evidence showing exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
why would otherwise all of these things have existed?
it seems as if we tried to say something!
people could not create any of these things.
but people can tell stories fabulovat.
and they were people who write all the texts that pretend that the word of God.
any supposedly holy learning any religion in the world itself as the will of the people, not the gods.
people who have been moved by '' or 'inspired by' their favourite gods, or the need to listen to the dictates of angels, but these texts have been written by more than mere smrtelníky with a certain degree of imagination, not angels and certainly not gods.
if there is indeed one real god, would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, über-galaktický supergénius ultimátní entity, the space.
if being such size sometimes wrote a book, there would be only one such paper, one which.
it would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, drawing parallels or alternatives in any language, as mere account of authors, with this work could not measure.
and people would it not blind trust, because it was a consistent, underpinned by verifiable and true evidence and kingly functions, deep morality and wisdom far above all human limits.
permanently would inspired each readers to unity common faith.
if it were written by God, we did not expect nothing less.
but what we see instead, it is the exact opposite.
instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth we have many different religion without a common origin and all the continuously fragment into increasingly separate denomination, seeking a disputed truth and each is somehow a divine leadership, regardless of the continuing the divergence and decoupling in every respect.
was the Jewish, Christian, Islamic the Koran, bahá 'with' lláhův kitáb-i-akdás, zarathuštrovy avesty, sikhský adí-granth, mahabharátská bhagavad-gita or paper, Paper mormonova urantia are all considered 'absolute right' and 'revealed word a genuine single god' and the life of each of them say that others are wrong.
the only logical explanations probably is that people are, to a certain extent.
none of the aforementioned books has compared to other no advantage.
none of them has the backing and no cannot be historically confirm.
my name is as paul maier, and I am a professor of ancient history to Western michiganské University.
I am not saying that I am proved that the Bible is reliable and historic accurate.
of course, it is not.
still, you must have faith.
all of them require faith and also apologia (defending), because it contains irregularities, absurdity and primitive ideas once considered true that have already been overcome.
so we cannot claim that they are proof of the divine wisdom.
many of them promotes heinous atrocities instead of morality and many of them have argued that were confirmed by the fulfilment of prophecy - with the fact that every also may contain prophecy that has not been fulfilled.
the leading theologians concede that all of the sacred texts of any religion were written by lidskýma hands and are subject to interpretation, images and perspectives of their primitive and often prejudices consumer politically motivated authors, thereby explain much of contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in bibli.
I would not call it contradictions, instead of comments.
we must point out once again that we have two different authors, whose work was somehow smíchána together during any redaktorské revision.
it is right that the genesis has more than one of the author, and certainly not with its tale heard an eyewitness!
some experts now distinguish four different sources only for pentateuch, i.e. five books' mojžíšových 'and mojžíšovi nepřipisují authorship any of them, because almost certainly did not exist, as it is in bibli described.
experts agree that genesis was formed (probably ezdrášem) from several mutually for unrelated oral traditions of less than 2500 years ago.
other documents have been přefiltrovány at the same time, all are attributed to human authors.
the Bible is not by chance that the old, as its believers think.
svitky from dead sea is the oldest archeologickými findings texts known for its unfinished basis for all Western monotheistic faiths, and yet they are for many centuries younger than roots zoroastriánství, Buddhism, Hinduism, helénismu, druidských cults, Chinese or the Egyptian religion.
Christianity has as gnostická belief, follow docéti and ebionité and their completely different perspectives on ježíše which will combine in a compromise entitled orthodoxy.
other Christian groups as luciferiáni were dispersed by and discredited other revisions.
one of these uprav relates to the king ugaritu, which ruled against 3,500 years ago.
because of his followers constitute major risk for young mojžíšké religion, the authors of the new law decided to mock and even 'al zebula' master of Mount 'change on belzebuba' master much '.
so the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently modified both religious and political reasons.
the remaining part of what has happened to the new law was kanonizována in the 4th century A.D. in a series of komisních decisions on the Bundestag in nikaji.
four of the Gospel was adopted and 16 have been rejected by the eye, as if the fact that some things have to accept or reject the vote.
the way for developed depended on what is read on Sundays in the Christian centres.
what is the second reading on Sunday after velikonocích in jeruzalemské Church?
and what, in the Roman Church in the same time?
and gradually find that it was close to those same evangelijním stories.
and so the canon is made from the wisdom of the Church.
so they simply adopted as gospel any relevant stories that flows between uneducated masses at that time.
but so deliberately they have received more than ten books of the Bible, even though they covered books, which have been approved.
between odmítnutými headings as we find the files of the apostles and False prophets.
why should we divine word should refer to books, which are just words, some people and / or have or are not available?
who was a real editor?
the Bible is often mentions human authors.
but how could be approved in this way, if the god real the author of this random míchanice legends, parable enough and žalmové lyrics?
the Bible was certainly written people and certainly not too osvíceními, rather the contrary!
that is the reason why it is so much of its content historically and scientifically completely wrong, whether it is almost anything from beginning to end.
we are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys can speak, believed in spells, bloody victims, ritual charm, očarované objects ohnivé astrology nostrums, and five elements art.
they thought that when we use a charming-rod that someone postříkají blood, cure him from leprosy.
we are talking about people who thought that pigs are přežvýkavci and netopýři are birds and whales are fish and I write that is the whole number.
these people believed that, when will show pregnant every pruhované models, gives birth pruhovaná calves.
how would this could tell someone who knows something about genetics?
the authors of this book that, of course, did not know.
if the Bible as it was written some higher beings, then it does not contain such errors, which contains.
if this is not really the parent beings and was supposed to be a literal history, then there was nothing from what it contains.
as a moral guides totally failed because the majority of the original hebrejských files it was written uneducated and bigotními divochy, who ignored or support cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, abuse of slaves, abuse of family members, the abuse of children, violence against children, abortion, looting, murder, kanibalismus, genocide and prejudice against the race, nation, religion, gender, and sexual orientation.
to defend their inhumanity by claiming that God will take place.
but the Creationists all this is ignored.
some of their websites admit that, if there is any point in contravention of the Bible, then it must be ignored.
and why?
because if the Creationists should not their loved ones books, they should not God.
in their world is one and the same thing.
it is ironic that refuse to God 'work' as' worship creatures instead creator '.
but they consider the word of God and man for the word of God and even insist that refutation of their supposedly 'holy' books somehow disproves God as such.

apple icloud supposedly succumbed to hackerům, on the public were naked images celebrities

the supposedly is gained unauthorized access to the user accounts on servers applu, where it is disabled users recorded through automatic backup images from iphonů and ipadů.
apple, the problem has been expressed.

Ukraine ’ s General: zajatého čecha I have neosvobozoval
exclusive interview with generálplukovníkem aktuálně.cz volodymyrem rubanem which exempts Ukrainian soldiers from the grip of pro-Russian separatists.
kyjev / praha - 'excuse me, I must take this... for me from doněcka' apologized perhaps eight times in an exclusive interview with aktuálně.cz Ukrainian generálplukovník volodymyr ruban, otherwise the director of the centre of the liberation of prisoners of war.
generálplukovník volodymyr ruban in television debate.
in any such interruptions, it was not possible neslyšet the names of people, their numbers or where they are - and should be - which ruban clarifies its counterpart at the other end of the phone.
this includes the - ',' end one of breaking discussions with doněckem and once again turn to ours.
volodymyr ruban is general in wait, former pilot jet fighters and an active participant in the anti-government protests on majdanu.
even yesterday - when we are agreeing interview - was in doněcku.
the liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the grip of pro-Russian separatists is twenty-four hours a day.
aktuálně.cz: you may know that on the side of the pro-Russian separatists are fighting and češi.
our kontrarozvědka estimates the number to 30.
can there be, however, and much more.
have you with some Czech prisoner in your negotiations met?
freed volodymyr ruban: I have captured srby, dagestánce, čečence, one švéda, gruzínce... but čecha has not yet.
but I know to whom in praze turn if we encountered on your zajatého countryman and able to convince him.
Ukraine ’ s soldier captive separatists
a.cz: what do čechům who are engaged in proruským separatists and the Ukrainian soldiers is used?
they should understand that if such as češi fighting in the Ukrainian praporech volunteers and separatists is used, it is for questioning without mercy zastřelí, as well as any other foreigners.
separatists consider these men for rent mercenaries and they do nothing does nothing other than death.
but if, for example, the Ukrainian soldiers used the doněckých separatists - and between them, even čecha - so it pulls behind bars and act with him as a prisoner of war.
the guy simply to survive.
the Ukrainian Party behaves in war as a state.
a.cz: and how much you have managed to save the Ukrainian prisoners?
as I understand it, and in return.
some sources say that no longer crossed a hundred men.
we have long ago stopped count how many people have helped.
we are, however, is only liberated... before the war nezachránili, if they choose in fighting to continue.
zachránci are in the war of doctors, the surgeons, but we certainly do not.
the way it is.
and every day we have more and more.
every day we will save someone.
sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
and do not need to be always on the exchange.
sometimes we need to release of prisoners and a human plea.
a.cz: it is rumored that you are in a few months, with a pro-Russian separatists authority and even confidence... as in Ukrainian society.
how do you managed to build respect both the warring parties?
the hard question.
one of officers in kyjevě me he dubbed the 'mad General with steel balls'.
insulting me.
and perhaps even captures the essence of our work.
as head of the Ukrainian young officer corps I have authority has been before.
never nechytračím, nepodvádím and I always speak.
whatever happens, so I discussed honestly and I speak the truth.
even when it is the Ukrainian Government, or the doněcké or luhanské very uncomfortable.
if torture and kill people?
so they simply say that it is tortured and killed.
and that these are crimes.
they often at life, even me in the exchange of prisoners and capturing... this work for me can ever be the end of... I do not need to return.
a.cz: how many executions and the torture of prisoners, you know?
... (long pomlka)... the torture of prisoners was during interrogations resort ukrajinci and separatists.
unfortunately.
and executions?
they are taking place on doněcké side.
that also Ukraine ’ s army executes prisoners, I do not have the information.
no signs of Ukraine ’ s army something similar committing.
the number of executions have an idea of the state, but I cannot and do not want.
a.cz: tell me charaktery and the motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
among them are officers, but also veterans of afghánistánu.
it seeks to autonomy, and perhaps even democracy in doněcku or luhansku - that they say.
they do not want any more to play the game with the Ukrainian oligarchs.
separatists have oligarchs full teeth and their implacable opponents - to life and death.
as we say - přejedli them after the throat.
the same dreams and aspirations of people have, incidentally, clear and majdanu.
and now a little zaspekuluji: Russia supports the separatists and the West, on the contrary, the Ukrainian state.
one speculation, I consider it a great and the other, on the contrary, for a small.
has this sentence but conceals the irreconcilable contradiction.
a.cz: how do you, for example, appears to be one of the most severe leaders pro-Russian separatists igor bezler?
always when překračuji line front, I am no weapons and I show soldiers or militants rozpřažené bare hands.
and I am always have both of those two hundred or three hundred meters in his sights or optickém zaměřovači.
the faces of people who, for me, is always well see... and they can ever hit havoc its weapons.
výsadkář, experienced Colonel with the German and the Ukrainian ancestors.
it is considered a Russian officer, but his family - mother - live on ukrajině.
they believe that ukrajina should not exist.
and if so, just as a small governorships retain wide powers in large Russian empire.
in any case, this time and ukrajinu considers it a kind of the misunderstanding.
such a state, it should not be.
at the same time, its implacable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
a.cz: if we are talking about charakterech - in a show of Ukrainian television you your Prime Minister arsenije jaceňuka described as weak, bezradného and a worn-out 'leader', which would do best if quickly left.
for those three hundred meters walk I always at least five times.
why should I thus hide the view that jaceňuk is very weak prime minister, and that is detrimental to our country?
a.cz: you have to share in the war in ukrajině?
you may know that ukrajinci jaceňuka přezdívají 'králíkem'.
and it is not in the eyes of a rabbit ukrajinců animal from which would go fear or should other respect and authority.
its behaviour directly copied behaviour pig.
it is perhaps a good economist, but as the Prime Minister has won the war right in Parliament, asking it to play with him his intrigue, threaten the role that will lay... he must country managed to manage it, and in times of war and protected.
when the Prime Minister of a country does not have the right to a family, friends, rest on plačtivé emotions.
he is the first of the ministers ukrajiny.
and jaceňuk?
acts like a pubertální girl.
yes, it is tired, but also a weak, because it was never a strong... campaigning for ukrajinu, are constantly complaining at all.
it should therefore leave.
the sooner the for ukrajinu better.

film festival otherwise is experiencing a crisis
after the huge enthusiasm about opening movie birdman, whose director alejandro gonzález iňárritu suddenly among serious candidates for the golden lion, further days after the impression that interest in 71. annual festival in benátkách died down somewhat.
whether, therefore, that the number of jobs in the Chamber has risen to two hundred or so that, after birdmanovi followed criticism recognised, but for viewers less attractive images as a document on the genocide in indonésii 1960 ’ s view of silence and other films, social issues from American 99 homes for Iranian point in cinemas simply remained empty seats.
the heroes of comic
even the red carpet before festivalovým palace neobléhaly crowds, such as in the past and supposedly ceased to be a problem at the last moment to find a place in the hotel.
the crisis in itálii speaks more than elsewhere, and it is not surprising that has affected, and so the honourable institution as biennale and oldest Film Festival in the world.
fortunately, the crisis shows a lack of personalities, here, however, specifically in connection with the movies.

points to cool
indeed, this year, the film is in benátkách very well.
the black soul that directed by francesco munzi, became the first... birdmanovi odměněným long a standing ovation.
kalábrijská branch of the mafia it considered view of family relations between clans that mutually are fighting for power and money, and director has managed to reconcile all prerequisites for a good film: quality scenario, camera, music and actors.
take the chamber psychothriller hungry heart, which he saverio costanzo with albou rohrwacherovou in the role of women, their misguided úzkostlivostí nearly kills off their own child.
on the contrary, from the French competing films, pending a warm welcome and ransom for glory, or 3 heart, both works material on the traditional model of consumption films, which are based on popular rock leaders.
but, after all, two really excellent films, birdman and black soul, are not in the first half of the festival so little.

last week, placed the victory proponentům Scottish independence at hand
the campaign for the Scottish independence was in danger that this mistake will napotřetí, when almost placed on billboards around the skotsku question whether they want to skoti be rich.
but the hearts of Scottish constituents, you do not get that you will appeal to their wallet, or we will not achieve their respect, when you start to threaten.
the new law is in skotsku still alive, although little skotů even go even today in the church.
skoti have far greater tendency to expel směnárníky from the temple, than to let them dictate how to vote.
the head of the Scottish nationalists alex salmond this well knows, and therefore, in a television debate has repeatedly dotazoval his rival, unionistického darlinga, whether it is prepared to respect the 'the sovereign will of the Scottish people', if the Scottish constituents voted for independence, and to support the single currency for skotsko for anglii.
this darlinga forced to Scotland ’ s choice between civil society and londýnskými financiers, and with grimasou fell into the trap.
of course, the darling support mandate Scottish constituents.
but the debate on what will have skotsko currency has been more or less neutralised.
what really motivates Scottish constituents is fairness, jobs and the defence of the public health that citizens are free of charge.
darling currency supported in London bankers and also the impression that will not protest against the privatisation of health care.
thus, as he said, 'salmond vlezl in bed with the Conservatives'.
it is for each Scottish policy very dangerous position.
everyone knows that the Scottish voter Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with the Conservatives.
this was confirmed by Michael cameron in skotsku speak not to voters, but to the Association 'bosses', to the Confederation of British Industry.
it is becoming clear that cameronovo refusal to discuss the independence of the Scottish Prime Minister salmondem unionist campaign was a serious mistake.
cameron so looks like a cowardly absentující domestic.
skoti respect, if it came to a debate with the Scottish prime minister.
cameron at least able to say that skotsko can be 'successful independent countries'.
alistair darling fails to say nothing of the sort, it almost physical pain.
what it says it is clear: we do not have skoti jumping and must accept what is.

prodemokratičtí activists in hongkongu day after the decision to vote provoke the Chinese authorities
near postávala pekingu loyal to the group of people who were waving the Chinese flag.
the permanent Commission National People's Congress on Sunday agreed that the elections in 2017 at hongkongu part in only two of the three candidates.
all the candidates must first to win the support of the appointment of the Commission, which will probably consist of members of the faithful pekingu.
because of this decision is for the opposition Democrats almost impossible to get on the voting lists and get pro-demokratické activists to restore promise and cripple financial centre hongkongu protest movements “occupation base ”.
in hongkongu political reform is the main cause of tension, China ’ s leaders fear that the requirement for democratisation will spread to other cities.

putin asks kyjev to Eastern ukrajinou began negotiations on the “national sovereignty ”
according to the events of the Russian newspaper asked on Sunday Russian President vladimír putin that the Ukrainian Government to fight the separatists in the east of the country and immediately opened negotiations on the “national sovereignty ” of the breakaway regions.
his interlocutor dmitrij peskov later explained that putin its point did not intend to suggest that the Eastern ukrajiny under the control of the separatists will become part of the ruska, but that their status within the ukrajiny should be reviewed to Russian-speaking area has the power to protect their rights and interests.
putinova challenge you can see the Government to act with proruskými rebels as equals, is a clear strategy, according to which follows from the unrest five months ago: help separatists to occupy territory and donuťte Ukrainian government to grant the newly vyhlášenému novorusku de facto independence, to take place with the West could combine with ruskem.
in an interview with the state television channel putin condemned the military action, to regain the eastern area doněcka and luhansku which, in March and April took control of the separatists after moskva 18 March annexed krymský Peninsula belonging ukrajině.
kreml and separatists recently occupied territories have described as “novorusko ” or“ new Russian, ” a term which refers to the famous předrevoluční days of the Russian empire.
Russia ’ s news agency itar-tass published putinova words, according to which it is “prisoner illusion ” anyone who believes that are on the horizon peace negotiations, because the Ukrainian politicians started before the parliamentary elections on 26 October campaigns, while the government forces attacking the civilian population in the areas of controlled separatists.
“in the interests of the people living in these areas, we need to launch a meaningful negotiations and not only the legal issues, but also a political organisation of society and on the status of state sovereignty of the south-east ukrajiny, ” he said.
peskov said that putinova reference to national sovereignty was intended in the context of a broader autonomy, which, with the leadership of kyjeva is already several months and which is to mitigate the concerns of the Russian-speaking regions from the threat of cultural and linguistic rights.
peskov said that the autonomy of the eastern regions can only give the Ukrainian Government.
it is not a matter for discussion between ukrajinou and ruskem peskov, said, “because this is not a conflict between ruskem and ukrajinou, but on the internal Ukraine ’ s conflict. ”
intervention spokesman kremlu which should correct interpretation of the “wrong ” putinových points out the approach to tackling the separatists ruska leadership in the East, which is different from open the krymu, where the majority of the population of origin dvoumilionové among ethnic rusům.
moskva should be much more difficult to annex and doněck and luhansk on East ukrajiny, because the majority of 6.5 million people are not rusové and opinion polls carried out before the conflict has shown broad support for the remaining on ukrajině.
autonomy, which Russian diplomats have acted in international fora, regional governments on ukrajině has the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, and in fact so give kremlu de facto control over the territory, which would have combined with Russian mainland krymem.
the Black Sea Peninsula anektovaný five months ago is the seat of the Russian Fleet, maritime trade background and historic coastal resort.
the area between the Russian rostovem and krymem are also Centre down factories and sléváren that produce the important components for the Russian army.
Ukraine ’ s President petro porošenko during its inauguračního speech on 7 June suggested that the Ukrainian legislators - for new elections - consider amendments to the constitution, which would diverse regions have more control over their finances and language status.
this vision of autonomy, but very different from vision kremlu and separatists. moskva is accused of militarisation and the incitement to violence.
putinova last appeal to the separatists kyjev acted as equals followed the progress of the insurgents last week after the Eastern ukrajinu leaked Russian troops and tanks from before a quiet area along the azovského Sea.
separatists stronger rusy novoazovskem take control of such a force that Ukraine's security authorities concerned that it is on the march in order to fill a strategic coastal territories to krym.
this has accelerated the tremendous civilian and military efforts opevnit mariupol, port with metalurgickými kombináty about 500 000 inhabitants, which lies between novoazovskem and close the door on krymský peninsula.
porošenko on Saturday at meetingu leaders of the European Union in bruselu and urged action to prevent further Russian aggression against ukrajině, a former Soviet Republic, which is the last 23 years of independent.
"we are coming to a point of no return, ” he warned porošenko.
on the territory of ukrajiny is now thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks.
the summit aanwezig did not put any definitive steps - leaders are calling for the adoption of additional sanctions against rusku in the case of closer unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel andrij lysenko, the spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday in kyjevě reporters say that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in ilovajsku after last week, two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1 000 troops has made its way into doněcké area, to support the beleaguered separatists.
the first of 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers who were captured in ilovajsku in Russian invasion, were in Sunday traded for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the interior ukrajiny, said in the Sunday lysenko.
