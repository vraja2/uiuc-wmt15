<seg id="1">The renewal of the very american ideal that labour rights are also human rights </seg>
<seg id="2">Kongresmeni keith ellison and john lewis proposed law , which is to organise a union protected as a civil law . </seg>
<seg id="3">“ depending on how they operate unions operate jobs for the middle class , ” says ellison , democratic senator for minnesotu , which is the co @-@ chair of the committee . </seg>
<seg id="4">Therefore , i am so proud , together with a model of occasional rights johnem lewisem imagine the law which strengthens the position of the workers . </seg>
<seg id="5">This far @-@ reaching legislation will give workers the same legal possibilities how to prevent discrimination in organising in trade union , as with other forms of discrimination - and put a stop to the forces of protiodborové </seg>
<seg id="6">To amend the law on labour relations , so as to allow all the staff who face discrimination , if we want to be involved in the trade unions , judge in a civilian court - and vysoudit compensation or compensation - it is right and necessary initiative . </seg>
<seg id="7">Certainly , but this is not a radical initiative - at least not according to the american standards . </seg>
<seg id="8">The best way to understand what ellison , lewis and other proponents presented in the law , it is once again to follow up on the american ideal . </seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the fight , which have taken place in recent years - in wisconsinu , michiganu and other states - američani once supported countries around the world to accept , expanded and respect labour rights . </seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time and millions of američanů is still remember when the country in the same breath to promote democracy , freedom of expression , freedom of the press , and the right to assembly . </seg>
<seg id="11">When the united states after world war ii , japan , general douglas macarthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution drafted by so as to ensure that the military autocracy hideki toja will be replaced by democracy . </seg>
<seg id="12">They believe that the workers and their trade unions play a role in shaping the new japonska , included in one language and openly acknowledged that “ the right of workers to collect , collectively to negotiate and to act is guaranteed . ” </seg>
<seg id="13">When the united states after the second world war , a german , general dwight michael eisenhower and his advisers němce encouraged to create a constitution , which will ensure that fascism adolfa hitlera will be replaced by a strong democracies . </seg>
<seg id="14">Němci realising that employees will be in the new people need to organise and promote and , therefore , include a clause , which openly says : “ right to create alliances that will safeguard and improve employment and economic conditions will every individual and each profession or profession guaranteed . </seg>
<seg id="15">Arrangements that will have the right to restrict or will seek his damage will be abolished . measures leading to meet this purpose are unlawful . </seg>
<seg id="16">When the former first lady eleanor rooseveltová chaired the international commission on human rights , which proposed the universal declaration of human rights , which was adopted in 1948 , nations as global treaty , included in its proponents and rooseveltová guarantee that everyone has the right to the protection of their interests to trade unions and enter into them . ” </seg>
<seg id="17">Američané generations accept the basic premise that labour rights are human rights . </seg>
<seg id="18">When countries advising the other countries to create civil and democratic society , američané explained that the right to create labor unions - and their participation in the collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as an equal partner - must be protected . </seg>
<seg id="19">Now that these rights are in americe attacked , it is absolutely necessary to return to the us ideal that working people must have the right to a free and open society organise and promote . </seg>
<seg id="20">As fifty years ago said reverend martin luther king jr . : </seg>
<seg id="21">History is a teacher . </seg>

<seg id="24">Those who trade unions , attack , these simple truth forget history , but it is nevertheless . </seg>
<seg id="25">History does not forget , and we should also not . </seg>
<seg id="26">Formal recognition of rights as human - and extending the protection of civil rights , so as to prevent discrimination in the organisation of the trade unions - is long overdue . </seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips , as under water get better photos and videos </seg>
<seg id="2">If you are interested in taking pictures or shooting under water , you have a large selection of equipment . </seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is compact such as nikon coolpix aw120 or outdoorová camera type gopro hero3 + silver edition , which is around $ 300 . </seg>
<seg id="4">These pictures i 've on family celebration of a few foťáky , all cost less than $ 350 . </seg>
<seg id="5">It is one of the equipment , but in order to achieve the best results are a few rules . </seg>
<seg id="6">Double @-@ check the equipment . </seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have waterproof camera , make sure that the batteries and other sections are firmly closed . </seg>
<seg id="8">Furthermore , configure your camera , depending on the type of photos and videos you buy . </seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and video cameras everywhere have scenic or natáčecí regime that exposure optimizes the dark environment under water . </seg>
<seg id="10">And you tackle this , to find out how far you its equipment immersed . </seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are intended to 5 , further to 50 to 60 . </seg>
<seg id="12">Please read our guide to buying and evaluation of the digital cameras in day @-@ to @-@ day and vodotěsném implementation . </seg>
<seg id="13">I always a few images - a lot of them fail . </seg>
<seg id="14">Compact cameras are comfortable , which will help you to design photos , but do not have it period . </seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you are comfortable , under water will be wrong to see and composition scope will nepředvidatelná . </seg>
<seg id="16">So we always do more images . </seg>
<seg id="17">If the camera bracketingový regime that makes a series of images with slightly different dispersals exposure , take advantage of this . </seg>
<seg id="18">Keep is close to the levels . </seg>
<seg id="19">With deeper equipment light significantly declined . </seg>
<seg id="20">If it is possible to hold the photo shoot in the swimming pool , close to the lake or sea levels . </seg>
<seg id="21">It also allows to capture the fotkách more light - the deeper potopíte , the less you colors . </seg>
<seg id="22">Bail , close to fotografovanému object . </seg>
<seg id="23">This is an excellent council if so on land , but under water is even more important because of tlumenějšímu light . </seg>
<seg id="24">This is particularly important if natáčíte with outdoorovou camera : such facilities are usually a firm and wide angle lens , which means that if you want to fill fotorámeček , you need to points more . </seg>

<seg id="28">2 500 deaths per year for this disease is more than twice the number of victims of car accidents . </seg>
<seg id="29">The number of deaths on the consequences of the mezoteliomu per year since 1980 and estimated deaths in the future in a large británii </seg>
<seg id="30">Why only now being felt the effects , although it is using asbestos for years illegal ( all kinds of asbestos was eventually prohibited by law in 1999 ) is that usually takes several decades than mesotheliaoma develop . </seg>
<seg id="31">Disaster in the form of mezoteliomu not not only veterans construction industry . </seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos has been , and still is , in many cases , the present in homes , in which we live , offices , where we are working in schools , where we learn , and in shops , in which we are purchasing . </seg>
<seg id="33">Mesotheliaoma therefore does not respect the social layer of wealth , jobs or age . </seg>
<seg id="34">Privileged edifice from london commercial home after public schools are not shelter . </seg>
<seg id="35">The parliament is full of asbestos . </seg>
<seg id="36">Even the hospital , in which we should treat , are the disposal of this deadly carcinogen . </seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew lawson was old . </seg>
<seg id="38">Neither nepokládal isolation . </seg>
<seg id="39">Trying to find out where could come into contact with asbestos . </seg>
<seg id="40">Then on this . </seg>
<seg id="41">" it is possible that a lot of asbestos in suterénních corridors like ' with comfortable beds , where i spent six years of practice , ” he wrote . </seg>
<seg id="42">All - students , nurses and doctors and vrátní - call them . </seg>
<seg id="43">The question is , how many of my family will receive the same disease ? </seg>
<seg id="44">Unfortunately , this was the question , which was part of the answer . </seg>
<seg id="45">“ from the four doctors , who were in practice in the room with comfortable beds and which are then in the last five years has shown mesotheliaoma , ” said in a letter in 2010 , “ i am the only still alive . ” </seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us ill ? </seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew lawson was with mezoteliomem diagnosed , when he was 48 . </seg>
<seg id="48">When 17 february of this year , he was 55 . </seg>
<seg id="49">To survive with this diagnosis as long as it is not business as usual . </seg>
<seg id="50">55 % of people diagnosed with mezoteliomem die in eight months since the diagnosis . </seg>
<seg id="51">Disease is always fatal . </seg>
<seg id="52">Now , therefore , we can only reiterate lawsonovu question : “ how many of us is the same disease ? ” </seg>
<seg id="53">According to a prominent british expert on mesotheliaoma professor juliana peta best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050 , when the asbestos epidemic in británii , die around 90 000 people . </seg>
<seg id="54">Most of them are currently does not know that , in this way . </seg>
<seg id="55">Azbestový mine in quebecu , kanadě </seg>
<seg id="56">When follows from an obvious consulting the writings of the archives of the courts , which has affected often turn and require a settlement , shows how much mezoteliomická disaster . </seg>
<seg id="57">For example , the june admitted society marks & spencer that from negligence put asbestos janice allenovou . </seg>
<seg id="58">Nine years has worked for the chain , from 1978 to roku1987 when seen in two stores in the section of the jobs - one of the flagship of society , the trade in the west end . </seg>
<seg id="59">Allenové was only 18 when , for the began to work . </seg>
<seg id="60">Today , two children , which is more than 20 . </seg>
<seg id="61">“ before it happened , ” he says , “ i am a mezoteliomu never before , i have rarely heard something to know about asbestos . </seg>
<seg id="62">It never dreamed that i could somehow concern . </seg>
<seg id="63">It is not the power of the people who know about asbestos . </seg>
<seg id="64">In fact , there is no asbestos one substance , but the group of six minerals . </seg>
<seg id="65">The name given due to its fibrózní structure , which gives it the power and ohebnost . </seg>
<seg id="66">From the six minerals were used in the construction of three . </seg>
<seg id="67">Most often , is now in buildings can find chryzotil , commonly known as white asbestos . </seg>
<seg id="68">It was used in the roof panels , floor tiles , bojlerových těsněních and even in brzdovém decor . </seg>
<seg id="69">It is not a deadly as other forms of asbestos , aanwezig and who it yet as “ a health risk , ” which can cause death . </seg>
<seg id="70">But it is more dangerous brown asbestos ( amosit ) and blue asbestos ( krokydolit ) . </seg>
<seg id="71">Británie was once the world 's biggest importer of brown asbestos and experts argue that “ there is a compelling , but an indirect evidence that this was the main reason for the unusually high incidence of mezoteliomu [ in mixed uk ] . ” </seg>
<seg id="72">Employees marsk & spencer asbestos was issued in the flagship store in the west end in londýně </seg>
<seg id="73">Janice allenová may be considered to be a victim of mezoteliomu , but the work juliana peta points out that its story is not unusual . </seg>
<seg id="74">The study of patients , argues that , “ a substantial part of the cases of mezoteliomu without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home was probably caused by exposure to asbestos in environment . ” </seg>
<seg id="75">A significant part of the exposition is caused by a “ normal use and zvětráváním ” buildings . </seg>
<seg id="76">It seems that no one could be sure that it is safe . </seg>
<seg id="77">The report goddard consulting , which has been investigating the westminster palace , shows that even the people at the centre of governments may not suggests that may be subjected to asbestos . </seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009 , goddard report , according to which are the staff mining and pipes for rooms of the parliamentary committee , the lethal contaminated asbestos fibres could be infringed something as benign as “ strong stream of air . ” </seg>
<seg id="79">Ministers are often accused of that care only about their own interests , in this case , but it can be the opposite of the truth . </seg>
<seg id="80">Although the directorate general services , parliament insisted that the westminster palace was “ positive medical certificates , ” is now agree that will need to be one million pounds , and several years of work that parliament closely prohlédnut , updates , electricity and removing asbestos , and after the elections in 2015 members would be rather than on the green benches in westminsteru sit in the premises of the centre of the queen alžběty ii . </seg>
<seg id="81">In the report goddardu costs that “ the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with the rules . ” </seg>
<seg id="82">It is not possible to say whether this discrepancy will cost lives . </seg>
<seg id="83">Everyone can now just wait . </seg>
<seg id="84">One of the people who have never been able to determine when to exposure to asbestos is graham man , a doctor . </seg>
<seg id="85">As well as andrew lawson has man ( 50 ) suspicion that was asbestos subjected to working in hospitals . </seg>
<seg id="86">“ i worked in the hospital , where it was proven presence of asbestos , ” he says , “ but in my case , that i cannot demonstrate . </seg>
<seg id="87">It is difficult to remember all the places where worked , and when they worked . </seg>
<seg id="88">Clearly , but the day at the beginning of december 2009 , when it zdolalo something like a fever . </seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45 , was the night and was in the middle of the operation . </seg>
<seg id="90">At the same time i roztřásl . </seg>
<seg id="91">This has come at once . </seg>
<seg id="92">I was a terrible history . </seg>
<seg id="93">I thought that nedojedu drive home . </seg>
<seg id="94">As a doctor , knew that pain comes from pohrudnice , výstelky around the lungs . </seg>
<seg id="95">But just as janice allenová have reason to believe that it is a mesotheliaoma . </seg>
<seg id="96">At the end of the month spent at home . </seg>
<seg id="97">Confusion doctors have found him the thorax and introduced him hrudní katetr to remove him from lung tekutinu , which sent on analysis . </seg>
<seg id="98">Yet determine the diagnosis . </seg>
<seg id="99">The situation is slowly improving and return to work . </seg>
<seg id="100">From time to time , but the symptoms back , often after zacvičil and zadýchal . </seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011 , came to operating room one abbottových patients with similar symptoms , and then for it was diagnosed mesotheliaoma . </seg>
<seg id="102">Even then , however , man nothing tie their own case . </seg>
<seg id="103">After all , the patient has been a few tens of years old and the work he came into direct contact with asbestos . </seg>
<seg id="104">In this case , the link clear . </seg>
<seg id="105">In september 2011 abbottův situation has worsened again and his doctor zkonzultoval his pictures from ct and x @-@ ray with a panel of experts . </seg>
<seg id="106">In december 2011 , just two years after the man started to feel ill , he was in the area between výstelkou hrudní cavity and výstelkou lung introduced with the camera . </seg>
<seg id="107">I am an optimist . </seg>
<seg id="108">I have a tendency to take no power , ” says . </seg>
<seg id="109">To be honest , i am with my concerns . </seg>
<seg id="110">But rachel , my wife , worry . </seg>
<seg id="111">The results of the biopsie reached between christmas and a new year , " said to me that this is mesotheliaoma . ” </seg>
<seg id="112">Graham man : diagnosed with mezoteliomem </seg>
<seg id="113">Man has begun to meet the sisters of charitable organisations macmillan and one advise him to get in touch with a lawyer . </seg>
<seg id="114">At the moment , realizing the epidemic . </seg>
<seg id="115">“ it turned out that asbestos was widely used , particularly in large public buildings , which are often azbestovou thermal insulation in the pipeline , ” says . </seg>
<seg id="116">For people who have been exposed to in these buildings , are now beginning to disease . </seg>
<seg id="117">Mesotheliaoma has now beginning to apply to younger people , who have no risk profession . </seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous tube heat @-@ insulated asbestos in hospitals was in the basement , it is unlikely that threaten patients . </seg>
<seg id="119">However , the members of staff , who suterénními removed went between buildings ( as andrew lawson ) or eat in suterénních dining halls ( as often graham man ) certainly come into contact with toxic substance . </seg>
<seg id="120">As we are now shows were decades after the war hospital patients , a place where we can save lives , but also a place which could endanger the lives of doctors , who are treated . </seg>
<seg id="121">Asbestos is removing today . </seg>
<seg id="122">They have bunsenův kahan built on azbestové częste </seg>
<seg id="123">And it is not just about hospitals . </seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos is often used in offices , stores , libraries and municipalities , owing to its excellent izolačním and nehořlavým characteristics . </seg>
<seg id="125">In schools . </seg>
<seg id="126">In fact , many people are exposed to asbestos in school . </seg>
<seg id="127">Somewhere in the countless hours chemistry students were bunsenův kahan on azbestovou material . </seg>
<seg id="128">Arose web sites dealing with the issue of asbestos in schools . </seg>
<seg id="129">Benign things like floor tiles or roofs shelter to tools in our homes normally contain asbestos . </seg>
<seg id="130">" this is the industrial poison long time without a large number of houses , ” describing andrew morgan , a lawyer who represent andrewa lawsona in its action against the beds in the room . </seg>
<seg id="131">In one case was the only contact with asbestos , on which a woman who mezoteliomem can remember , in the 1970 ’ s in breaking down open house . </seg>
<seg id="132">So we pay attention to boříte garden house . </seg>
<seg id="133">Bearing in mind that the disease is incurable , is a huge impact diagnosis . </seg>
<seg id="134">“ takes time you will , ” says graham man . </seg>
<seg id="135">I am back into work and tried to continue , but i found that we cannot focus on what i do . </seg>
<seg id="136">The operating theatre , i was two weeks ago . </seg>
<seg id="137">Then i realized that i will have to leave and deal with himself . </seg>
<seg id="138">Well , other christmas is nedožiju . </seg>
<seg id="139">One of the most difficult thing was the transition from a doctor on the position of the patient . </seg>
<seg id="140">As a myriad of patients from him and he remembers how felt confused in the amount of information that we have to tackle . </seg>
<seg id="141">" it was difficult to do everything to understand , ” says . </seg>
<seg id="142">“ i asked his doctor : “ how much time left me ? ” </seg>
<seg id="143">I was told that the twelve months . </seg>
<seg id="144">) , as i have said : “ no , other christmas is nedožiju . </seg>
<seg id="145">So it . ” </seg>
<seg id="146">Mesotheliaoma is particularly destructive , because the mechanism of what we kept alive - the respiration - is what causes cancer , which kills . </seg>
<seg id="147">The majority of cases mezoteliomu is caused by exposure to asbestos . </seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos fibres are small . </seg>
<seg id="149">When the asbestos fibres , will breathe , they may reside in pohrudnici , výstelce lungs . </seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibres pohrudnici , and may cause a mutation cells . </seg>
<seg id="151">“ problem are vdechnutá asbestos fibres jehliček @-@ shaped , ” explains professor this treasure , kardiochirurg , who in 2001 , he was simply ' with comfortable beds . </seg>
<seg id="152">In the same hospitals , where he was andrew lawson probably exposure to asbestos , and which is , paradoxically , the centre in the treatment of mezoteliomu . </seg>
<seg id="153">Treasure lawsona knows and an even more patients who were exposed to probably during the practice in the hospital . </seg>
<seg id="154">Jehličky asbestos in tissue treasure lung , says , “ the respiration is pushing on the periphery , where it is výstelka . </seg>
<seg id="155">Nature is right from the beginning of invasive . </seg>
<seg id="156">On mesotheliaoma routine treatment options used for other types of cancer , so do not work . </seg>
<seg id="157">žhavě is under discussion , for example , about the effectiveness of the operation . </seg>
<seg id="158">According to some would be worth trying . </seg>
<seg id="159">Treasure . </seg>
<seg id="160">“ cannot remove pohrudnici , ” says . </seg>
<seg id="161">Do not get around it scalpel . </seg>
<seg id="162">Cancer is “ too to chemotherapy ” that has “ has an effect , ” but cure . </seg>
<seg id="163">“ sometimes there is someone who lung cancer will survive , ” says treasure . </seg>
<seg id="164">But , in the end , everyone will die . </seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately , some patients live far longer than expected . </seg>
<seg id="166">Author stephen jay gould died 20 years after diagnosis . </seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years since its own diagnosis graham man is still struggling . </seg>
<seg id="168">After the findings of the man mezoteliomu contacted with andrew lawsonem which , four years after its diagnosis , individual support and adviser for as disabled people . </seg>
<seg id="169">When called , happily , presented : “ hello dovolali you on the base of cancer . ” </seg>
<seg id="170">“ was a great deal of positive , ” says man . </seg>
<seg id="171">The disease diagnosed him four years ago and was always very active . </seg>
<seg id="172">At the beginning of the abbottovi offer six cycles of chemotherapy which lasted for four months , and is likely to live longer only a month . </seg>
<seg id="173">“ i was a desperate , ” says . </seg>
<seg id="174">That is what i wanted to pay . </seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson but “ has managed to show in optimističtějším light . ” </seg>
<seg id="176">After a few doctors , man has decided to continue to treat with professor loic lang-lazduskim of decoupling hrudní surgery in the hospital beds in the room . </seg>
<seg id="177">“ i had the advantage that i did not wait to send me to him , but i just there and they called me prohlídli ” admits graham . </seg>
<seg id="178">Normal patients would have to get žádanku and have had to pay for it . </seg>
<seg id="179">In order to be able to get the best available treatment for patients with mezoteliomem question of money is crucial . </seg>
<seg id="180">But when the different treatment , inevitably fail , many patients facing the next financial concerns - about the future of the family , which leave . </seg>
<seg id="181">And therefore , turning to the courts and want to compensation . </seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew lawson contacted andrew morgana from the fisher waterhouse llp . </seg>
<seg id="183">“ since 1898 let it be known that asbestos is harmful to health , ” says morgan . </seg>
<seg id="184">In the 1960 ’ s , but found that his very small amount may pose a risk to health . </seg>
<seg id="185">And here we have negligence . </seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew lawson with comfortable beds and , finally , but according to the morgana not “ full compensation , ” because lawson could not definitively demonstrate that mesotheliaoma was due to exposure to asbestos in the room comfortable beds . </seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into the case , however , the members of the beds , confirmed that the “ asbestos in inkriminované suterénní part was removed in the 1990 ’ s . ” </seg>
<seg id="188">It was for andrewa lawsona too late . </seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove the asbestos </seg>
<seg id="190">Exposure to asbestos fatal for one company or place of work - usually decades after happen - for patients with mezoteliomem seeking compensation has turned out to be a huge problem . </seg>
<seg id="191">A lot of former workplaces changed owners or go bankrupt . </seg>
<seg id="192">Record safeguards are lost . </seg>
<seg id="193">And those who are now accusations , are on their side , and that their prosecutors absolutely not . </seg>
<seg id="194">In response to this fact was this year adopted an important new legislation , which is for patients with mezoteliomem easier to pursue compensation , even if it is not possible to their former employer untraceable . </seg>
<seg id="195">The law has created a 350 ] the financial envelope are covered by insurance companies , which is intended to people diagnostikovaným after july 2012 , who can prove that they were subjected to asbestos , but do not have anyone to court . </seg>
<seg id="196">In that case , disability get 80 % of the amount that would put them in a normal case , the court gives as compensation - approximately 120 000 pounds . </seg>
<seg id="197">Every year is expected to 300 successfully vyřízených applications . </seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew morgan , as well as patients with mezoteliomem thinks that 350 million pounds is “ good work . ” </seg>
<seg id="199">" this is the agreement drafted insurance for insurance , ” says and points out that amount is a quarter of what would insurance companies have to pay , if allowed time and people with mezoteliomem would have been able to establish the former employer and the normal way is to prosecute them . </seg>
<seg id="200">Even mike penning , the former minister of labour and social affairs , admitted that the law of the “ should gaps . ” </seg>
<seg id="201">But penning the morgan admit that , given the seven deaths every year it was necessary to rapid action . </seg>
<seg id="202">The “ people are suffering and need help immediately , ” he said penning in december last year , during the second reading of the law on mezoteliomu . </seg>
<seg id="203">Graham man was in the care of professor loic lang-lazdunskiho 19 months . </seg>
<seg id="204">After the initial consultations recommended lang-lazdunski operation , which , unlike tiene treasura thought that has a positive effect . </seg>
<seg id="205">After the operation was followed by radiation treatments and chemotherapy - trojitá treatment for which lang-lazdunski can boast of the survival of the five years of up to 40 % of patients . </seg>
<seg id="206">Abbotta reinforced . </seg>
<seg id="207">" it is not , of course , the most important thing , ” says man . </seg>
<seg id="208">Patients that you still . </seg>
<seg id="209">There is something you drives . </seg>
<seg id="210">When without your situation could very quickly become . </seg>
<seg id="211">Graham man he had in march 2012 operation . </seg>
<seg id="212">In late august completed last from six cycles of chemotherapy . </seg>

<seg id="218">It takes . </seg>
<seg id="219">Man again took six cycles of chemotherapy . </seg>
<seg id="220">At the moment , they are not in his body no trace of cancer . </seg>
<seg id="221">But it is physically and emotionally gruelling process . </seg>
<seg id="222">You need to think about the practical things - on financial collateral to die , or to show a woman , how does the alarm at the pot . </seg>
<seg id="223">The bad news , you will be negative . </seg>
<seg id="224">You need to look ahead . </seg>
<seg id="225">As for the father ellie ( 16 ) and tamsin ( 14 ) , it is not always easy . </seg>
<seg id="226">" it is difficult for parents , ” says . </seg>
<seg id="227">It is difficult to decide what to say and how much to say . </seg>
<seg id="228">After diagnosis i holkám said that my situation means that i shall never old . </seg>
<seg id="229">The response was different . </seg>
<seg id="230">Tamsin is a social and wild . </seg>

<seg id="2">China ’ s parliament , despite proliferating discussions on democratic reform in the sunday decided not to allow the electorate in hongkongu nominate candidates in the elections in 2017 . </seg>
<seg id="3">It is likely that this step will create long @-@ promised protests in the business district hongkongu as activists have started to organise and prepare a few hours after the announcement . </seg>
<seg id="4">China ’ s popular congress essentially allows communist leaders to exclude any candidate who is not loyal to pekingu . </seg>
<seg id="5">“ may surprise to us , but rozzuřilo us , ” said zákonodárkyně emily lau , chair of the democratic party . </seg>
<seg id="6">This is not what peking promised . </seg>
<seg id="7">People in hongkongu lie . </seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime . </seg>
<seg id="9">In defence of china ’ s decision said the deputy secretary @-@ general of the standing committee of the national people 's congress if fei that allow public nomination in elections leadership hongkongu would cause “ chaos . ” </seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997 , when británie back číně governance hongkongu , promises peking that starting in 2017 will be able to vote for the inhabitants of the executive . </seg>
<seg id="11">China ’ s leaders present sunday decision as a democratic breakthrough , because hongkongu allows direct voting decisions but also clearly demonstrates that the chinese leaders remains firmly in the hands of the process of nominating committee which is strictly controlled pekingem . </seg>

<seg id="4">Two weeks after the protests in fergusonu in warrior hector because of the shooting of non @-@ militarised young man michaela browna , blogger miriam zoila perézová shift in the discussions white feminists . </seg>
<seg id="5">Found that when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and equality of income , a white feminists gender , race . </seg>
<seg id="6">The increased tension in the west , which attracted the attention of the national press , perézová noted that response white women in 100 % focuses on race . </seg>
<seg id="7">In comparison with the reactions černošek soon after the killing of 9 august , personal articles with titles like “ reflection working over fergusonem ” or “ feminism is not only about the oppression of women ” appeared relatively late in the day . </seg>
<seg id="8">According to the perézové but this represents an important change . </seg>
<seg id="9">“ i think in feministickém movement is the power of the people who would on race and privileges spoke at such a level , ” said . </seg>
<seg id="10">People feel that what has happened must express . </seg>
<seg id="11">For the crisis that we are facing , it is characterised by because [ situation in fergusonu ] is so racially vyhraněná that it had to draw attention . </seg>
<seg id="12">According to the professors english on state university in ohiu korithy mitchellové ferguson brought to light the problems that afroameričanky must face every day , in the cultural sphere is not seen as a “ women 's issues . ” </seg>
<seg id="13">“ i can to facebooku publish funny story of life with your partner and receive a 150 liků from people from all over the world , ” said mitchellová . </seg>
<seg id="14">When i will write something that barevní are in their own country in the trap is deafening silence . </seg>
<seg id="15">“ how is it possible that a woman can talk about relations , but not on the safety of the public space ? ” asked . </seg>
<seg id="16">As for černošky mitchellová that deal with the issue of race , gender and sexuality in american history , there is no dichotomy between the issues of race and gender . </seg>
<seg id="17">černošky could not afford the luxury of a these problems : every day to live in this mixed reality . </seg>
<seg id="18">Even today , the issue of working race and gender in mainstreamových feminist circles merge , angela hatteryová , professor lecturer female issue and gender studies on george mason university , says that their predecessors did the opposite . </seg>
<seg id="19">Between 1865 and 1890 was at least 10 000 blacks lynčováno and reason was in almost all cases of rape working , ” said hatteryová . </seg>
<seg id="20">To justify the lynching you need cooperation white women . </seg>
<seg id="21">According to the hatteryové schism between the white women and černoškami came when voting rights campaigner as susan b . anthonyová examined at the end of the 19th century terrain and realized that the electoral law can have only one group of people - women or blacks . </seg>

<seg id="25">We never černoškám help protect their husbands and children . </seg>
<seg id="26">Even after the women in 1920 gained the right to vote , it took ten years before they began to organize against lynching in southern women association for the prevention of lynching . </seg>
<seg id="27">The group was 40 years after the first černošky said on aid . </seg>
<seg id="28">According to the mitchellové white feminists in response to the questions that events in fergusonu brought - the issue of police behaviour , racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists have “ catching ” issues which černošky those generations . </seg>
<seg id="29">“ it would be great if women in these areas [ traditional feminism ] take the right to raise the child as seriously as to take the right to contraception ? ” raised mitchellová . </seg>
<seg id="30">The second wave of feminists , who have done a career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraception , now find what it means . </seg>
<seg id="31">Significant feminist activist as gloria steinemová taken two weeks after the shooting michaela browna attack facebook , where published just rebeccy carrollové from guardianu which dožadovala for white američané forcefully protest against racism . </seg>
<seg id="32">“ i hope that women who have different , but similar reasons for understanding of risk in society - and views on race in opinion polls markedly different - will seek to change , ” wrote steinemová . </seg>
<seg id="33">Although the steinemová intersekcionální feminism , which includes the issues of race , sex , its comments on the question of race in americe some confusing . </seg>
<seg id="34">Professionals from cleaner enterprise institute wwe smackdown sommersová , author of “ who stole feminism ? ” , said to the efficiency of the young men in the united states , especially young barevní men , are “ much more vulnerable than their sisters , ” but comments steinemové parties fergusonu face criticism that has previously . </seg>
<seg id="35">We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost no for boys . </seg>
<seg id="36">But when the white house launched a program we brother 's january , which should help vulnerable young blacks and hispáncům was for many feminists including glorie steinemové a resentful response . </seg>
<seg id="37">The relationship between the police to black community is not the only problem , which is coming to the fore mainstreamového feminism . </seg>
<seg id="38">After the us border police arrested this year in the south @-@ west of the country almost 63 000 minors unaccompanied minors , once again raised the issue of the reform of the immigration laws - this time as a women 's issue . </seg>

<seg id="1">For the second time this year we had to clean up studnu . </seg>
<seg id="2">The whole we always deleted , thus aiming virtually the second pond around the hut . </seg>
<seg id="3">Then we have pumped savo there . </seg>
<seg id="4">Incredible puch ! </seg>
<seg id="5">Our well in a cellar was given to be always enough wonderful fragrant water . </seg>

<seg id="15">Where away with pumps , with bad luck , where the motherboard quite nedoléhala , so was the utěsněný a piece of bricks . </seg>

<seg id="1">Still , it places a chill - as i enjoyed the star award </seg>
<seg id="2">This year , the organisers have prepared several changes . </seg>
<seg id="3">The greatest was change routes , which led the náplavku , rather than leading to yellow spa . </seg>
<seg id="4">I enjoyed the race , along with the rest of the rungo.cz team , i was about to him but experience a little from the other side . </seg>
<seg id="5">With the entire team , we have decided to personally zdravit our readers to stand , where we have jointly later than next and natáčeli videos . </seg>
<seg id="6">To my view from the other side dotáhl to perfection , i took the role of personal wires . </seg>
<seg id="7">Along with kamarádkou káťou we just before the start of the obediently placed at the end of the corridor 60 @-@ 70 minutes . </seg>
<seg id="8">With we have with friends around us , who were in the sector for faster runners . </seg>
<seg id="9">It had much time . </seg>
<seg id="10">A few poskoků on rozehřátí , enabled sporttestery , countdown and start ! </seg>
<seg id="11">Cries of elation , but instead of fast @-@ start followed cupitání to the starting line . </seg>
<seg id="12">After five minutes we come to the gate , all measuring and rozbíháme the pace of the hour ten . </seg>
<seg id="13">It features proplétáme hadem runners who , like káťa runs its first race . </seg>
<seg id="14">So far , all the lush , gradually declining the sun in the sky gives perspective vyšehrad almost all kýčovitý connotation . </seg>
<seg id="15">A vibrant meat stretching after the looks as if we ran a praha . </seg>
<seg id="16">On the very waterfront between vyšehradem and national theatre traditionally starting to see who is how many forces . </seg>
<seg id="17">Easy kopeček on palackého square forcing many runners slow down or to move to walk . </seg>
<seg id="18">Just before i see přeběhem in police escort and it flies vítek pavlišta incredible rate in the objectives . </seg>
<seg id="19">I hear obdivné ufuněné vzdychání other runners . </seg>
<seg id="20">I shall move on the edge of the track , encourage him to me plácnout , but just before i podvrtne leg and our hand with just a mine . </seg>
<seg id="21">Seběh theater street gives the opportunity for a short break and rozdýchání . </seg>
<seg id="22">It is necessary , there are points on which i views vyrazí breath . </seg>
<seg id="23">Pivot to bridge the threshold mánesově shows in the beauty of the setting sun . </seg>
<seg id="24">Nedýchám and feet me is hardly alone . </seg>
<seg id="25">For the first občerstvovačkou is the moment of truth . </seg>
<seg id="26">When přeběhu roads káťa škobrtne on obrubník and displays leap plavmo . </seg>
<seg id="27">I am looking at whether does not need assistance and spouštím a series of encouraging words that had time to think about the pain . </seg>
<seg id="28">Lifts and continuing goat alley , this is one of the nejužších jobs at this stage race track , there is not a flood of , but it must be well monitored . </seg>

<seg id="37">Only the sun has been slow and difficult day symbolically slowly puts an end to the race . </seg>
<seg id="38">The last climbing pivot to the bridge , and only stretch to objectives . </seg>
<seg id="39">The pace at which we run , i am struck by the fact that in děvčeti takes ? </seg>
<seg id="40">" places , we are under an hour 13 , makáme ! ' call . </seg>
<seg id="41">We have tried , sprintujeme and there are objective . </seg>
<seg id="42">The 13 and six seconds . </seg>
<seg id="43">Well , what can be done . </seg>
<seg id="44">Coach commissioned limit hour 20 . </seg>
<seg id="45">So the seven minutes under the plan . </seg>
<seg id="46">Which is super outcome . </seg>
<seg id="47">Just as the aim of the kátě podlamují feet , her to ) , where the moment to rest . </seg>
<seg id="48">It is up to them to see the exhaustion , but also the happiness of well odvedeného performance . </seg>
<seg id="49">After the moment it slowly odvádím out of the area . </seg>
<seg id="50">The euphoria does not give us think about the crowding various displays in the passageways to šatnám . </seg>
<seg id="51">Here we can see that the goat impasse was not the strictest place . </seg>
<seg id="52">It is only here in order to náplavka , which is under the strain of the almost ten thousand runners nacpaná to the breaking point . </seg>
<seg id="53">If someone does not like crowds , this is not the place for it . </seg>
<seg id="54">I , too , for the moment , lost its head , and i wonder whether the beautiful views and compared to previous years more interesting route , for what is happening in the end . </seg>
<seg id="55">I know from experience that the organisation of the race is no fun . </seg>
<seg id="56">If one adds to this ten thousand people , rich accompanying programme and the closure of the thresholds for all transport , it is a huge challenge . </seg>
<seg id="57">This change route has shown běžcům many interesting places , but also produced a few very unpleasant surprises . </seg>
<seg id="58">The excellent atmosphere rozpumpovaná in yellow spa became between the runners in the race . </seg>
<seg id="59">The organisers náhodní viewers around the track and increasing it on any metro line . </seg>
<seg id="60">In the city ’ s historic centre , unfortunately , must reckon with obstacles , which cannot be eliminated , but the goal of mass factory in place that is , on the one hand , ohraničeno walls and on the other the river , do not find the best solution . </seg>
<seg id="61">If you say that the race ended proběhnutím objective , i regard it as very nice . </seg>
<seg id="62">In order to have a bit worried about the health of those involved , but in the end all was well . </seg>
<seg id="63">Please contact us to debate whether you route liked and what you say to the situation in the end . </seg>

<seg id="1">Why can have space more proportions , and we are not </seg>
<seg id="2">Physics usually do best , but brianu greenovi from the colombian universities in 1999 out to succeed . </seg>
<seg id="3">His book elegant space has become accessible to the whole way to reach houštině problems today deals with many of the theoretical physicists gathered - uniting two well @-@ functioning , but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century : quantum theory and general theory of relativity . </seg>
<seg id="4">One of the causes of the success of the elegant space is undoubtedly that , in the case of finding a united physical theory is not about boring story . </seg>
<seg id="5">Physics fundamental problem between two key theories ( after all , at this moment is our space de facto divided into two worlds with different laws ) address and to tackle the imagination , that it is worth převyprávění 32 . </seg>
<seg id="6">Moreover , a complex dossier greene advise so lush and engaging that he cannot be blamed for many interesting did not include in their books . </seg>
<seg id="7">Moreover , its ' wrong ' largely rectified in the other two books : the structure of the space and hidden reality . </seg>
<seg id="8">Nothing would probably not the author objected to this , if his book zastarávala faster , but the fact is that , even after 15 years of the universe is still almost everything substantial , what would an informed with ambition of the world should know about this important part of the theoretical physics . </seg>
<seg id="9">It is quite likely that in the coming years will be in this area , only a little more vigorously ( to be due to the fact that urychlovač lhc is finally on the ' full gas ' ) , and this is a good moment to enter greenem peacefully open the doors of the modern world . </seg>
<seg id="10">How many dimensions may have our space ? </seg>
<seg id="11">The idea that our space , perhaps more than three spatial dimensions , you can read foolishly , provides , strangely or mysticky . </seg>
<seg id="12">Yet it is specific and completely acceptable . </seg>
<seg id="13">We understand that , at the moment , odvraťme its eyes from space as a whole to something přízemnějšímu , namely the long , thin garden hose to irrigate . </seg>
<seg id="14">Imagine that stometrovou garden hose to boot from one side canyon , on the other , and the whole scenery watching from půlkilometrové distance ( as in the image and on the following page ) . </seg>
<seg id="15">From a distance to a new direction in vodorovném hose , but only if it is netrpíte bystrozrakostí , the width of rozeznáte hardly . </seg>
<seg id="16">Given their large distance of you would think that mravenec donucený live on hose has only one dimension , which could go through : levo-pravý dimension along . </seg>
<seg id="17">If someone asks , where he was mravenec at the moment , from just one figure : distances ants from the left ( or the ) the end . </seg>
<seg id="18">All of this we want to say is that of půlkilometrové distance seems a long sleeves as a one @-@ dimensional object . </seg>
<seg id="19">In the real world of the width . </seg>
<seg id="20">If all zvětšíme , we suddenly the second dimension - in the shape of the circle ovíjející hose . </seg>
<seg id="21">In such zvětšeném perspective , it is clear that mravenec can actually move in two independent dimensions : in already well known levo-pravém dimension after length , but also in ' dimension in / against the direction of movement counterclockwise ' , i.e. around kruhovéhoprůřezu sleeves . </seg>
<seg id="22">You understand that , to determine the position of a small mravenečka you enter the two figures : how far from the end of and where it is kružnici ovíjející hose . </seg>
<seg id="23">This reflects the fact that the surface of the two @-@ dimensional ( note experts spot , that this chapter focuses solely on poruchovou theory strun . </seg>
<seg id="24">Neporuchové aspects raised 12 and 13 chapter . ) . </seg>
<seg id="25">The surface of the two @-@ dimensional : one long podélná dimension is znázorněna direct arrow , dimension in the direction of constituency , marked with circular arrow , it is short and svinutá . </seg>
<seg id="26">Between these two dimensions , however , is a clear difference . </seg>
<seg id="27">Dimension along sleeves is long and visible . </seg>
<seg id="28">Dimension ovíjející district of is short , ' svinutý ' and less apparent . </seg>
<seg id="29">We are aware of the existence of a dimension , we had to hose study with a significantly better definition . </seg>
<seg id="30">This example illustrates an important feature in space dimension . </seg>
<seg id="31">That is divided into two groups . </seg>
<seg id="32">They can either be large , vast and therefore directly , or , on the contrary , small svinuté and much less observable . </seg>
<seg id="33">Of course , in this case , we have just nepředřeli to ' svinutou ' dimension ovíjející width of exposed . </seg>
<seg id="34">It will take to help dalekohled . </seg>
<seg id="35">But if sleeves - as was thinner hair or kapilára - svinutou dimension we discovered only with great effort . </seg>
<seg id="36">Kaluza sent in 1919 einsteinovi your article in which he with stunning the idea that spatial geometry space can have more than three are known to all dimensions . </seg>
<seg id="37">Its radical kaluza ’ s claim that the additional dimension offers elegant and convincing framework in which can be einsteinovu general relativitu and maxwellovu elektromagnetickou theory vetkat into a single , united pojmové structures . </seg>
<seg id="38">Immediately , the question arises as to how far this kaluzův observation together with an obvious fact that we see just three dimensions of the area . </seg>
<seg id="39">The answer that kaluza quietly assumed between the lines , which spoke out clearly and clarify the swedish mathematician oskar за in 1926 , stands or falls by claiming that spatial geometry of our space can be as large as well as svinuté dimensions . </seg>
<seg id="40">This means that , as well as the dimension in the direction of sleeves is also our space large , vast and plain to see three dimensions , whose existence is every moment aware . </seg>
<seg id="41">But , by analogy with kruhovým district garden hose may have space and additional dimension , coiled up tightly in the area and a modest that still remain hidden even before our nejdokonalejšími experimental aparaturami . </seg>
<seg id="42">In order to get a clearer picture of the essence kaluzova remarkable proposal , let us stay even for a moment of sleeves . </seg>
<seg id="43">Imagine that , in the constituency of do we draw a black colour relatively close @-@ knit a circle . </seg>
<seg id="44">Zdálky hose still looks like a one @-@ dimensional line . </seg>
<seg id="45">With the telescope now thanks to detect svinutou dimension in the drawing even more , we will see the motive of image 2 . </seg>
<seg id="46">Clearly , we see that the surface of the two @-@ dimensional , with one dimension with a large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular . </seg>
<seg id="47">Kaluza and за came up with the idea that our space is similar in structure , but in addition to the one small circular dimension has three major spatial dimension , together , čtyřiprostorovédimenze . </seg>
<seg id="48">It is difficult to draw object with too many dimensions . </seg>
<seg id="49">In order to help our imagination , a note on the obr.3 ; it shows the two large dimension and one small circular dimension . </seg>
<seg id="50">On the picture zvětšujeme view of geometry area , just as we increase the surface . </seg>
<seg id="51">Each of the following level represents a huge increase in geometry area from the level of previous . </seg>
<seg id="52">Our space may have additional dimension ( see is the fourth level enlarge ) , if they are sufficiently svinuty into a small area ; that we make it clear that we still have not seen it directly . </seg>
<seg id="53">čtvercová network through the commonly known ' great ' dimension , while the circle with a new , malinkou and svinutou dimension . </seg>
<seg id="54">Just as the loop thread in densely utkaném carpets , and these circle exist in every corner of the usual dimensions - just because we are názornosti zakreslili only until you turn in lined network . </seg>
<seg id="55">The background image 4 shows commonly known structure area - a world around us - in such ordinary měřítkách , such as meters , znázorněných party in a small čtverečku lined network . </seg>
<seg id="56">On each of the following screenshot focusing on a small area of the image of the previous ; zvětšíme it to become visible . </seg>
<seg id="57">Initially , nothing is a special case , as we can see in the first few levels increase . </seg>
<seg id="58">However , when we move on its path for the microscopic properties geometry area on - the fourth level of increasing the 3 - we suddenly a new , in the shape of the circle svinutou dimension , a similar smyčkám thread in densely tkaném piece carpets . </seg>
<seg id="59">Kaluza and за came up with the idea that there is an additional circular dimension to any place in the direction of large dimension , as is also of traffic circuit at any point in its duration . </seg>
<seg id="60">In the interests of názornosti we circular dimension zakreslili only in some , regularly deployed points . </seg>

<seg id="1">Entrepreneurs in the area of washingtonu : with a turnover of economies are raising their taxes </seg>
<seg id="2">The growing economy means more customers , higher sales and new jobs . </seg>
<seg id="3">And higher taxes . </seg>
<seg id="4">According to a new survey , which was published last week , state and local corporate taxation in the country to accelerate the recovery of the economy last year slightly increased and firms in washingtonu were the exception . </seg>
<seg id="5">Entrepreneurs in marylandu and virginii together for fiscal year 2013 to state and local treasuries have done 27,6 billion , which is to 3.8 % higher than 26.6 billion dollars collected in 2012 . </seg>
<seg id="6">The tax burden - national and local - the last year has lifted by 4.3 % to 672 billions of dollars in comparison with the 3.9 % last year , and it was the third year in a row growth for 2009 and 2010 , when the tax cut . </seg>
<seg id="7">According to a study conducted by the professional company ernst & young and political groupings centres , he did so , state tax increase faster by 4.3 % than local levy on 3.9 % . </seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the tax revenue , 56 % of business tax , and 36 % of income marylandu is from companies . </seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia with 28 % , is showing in proportion to the smallest tax revenues of business . </seg>
<seg id="10">Researchers argue that the majority of the growth of tax revenue comes from an increase in the value of properties belonging to the firms which property taxes this year for three consecutive years , with the growth of -1 % increase by 3.7 % . </seg>
<seg id="11">Although the majority of profit comes from the large states as kalifornie , and texas , it seems that the same is also washingtonu . </seg>
<seg id="12">Companies in d.c. , marylandu and vriginii last year paid more than $ 10 billion to state and local taxes on real estate , compared to 9.6 billion in 2012 represents an annual increase of 4.2 % . </seg>
<seg id="13">A clear increase in the value of the real estate , however much nevyhání up national and local tax revenues in marylandu where property tax is less than one @-@ fifth of taxation of companies . </seg>
<seg id="14">For companies in virginii and d.c. represents a real estate almost half of the state and local taxation . </seg>
<seg id="15">“ in marylandu own a lot of real estate companies , in particular , the tax base in the vicinity of d.c. , the government or non @-@ commercial organisations that do not pay taxes , ” explained douglas lindholm , the executive director of the center so he did . </seg>
<seg id="16">So maryland is forced to rely much more on , for example , of tax revenue to pay for the same services , which are in other countries . </seg>
<seg id="17">The recent increase tax revenue from business cannot be připsáno only uzdravujícímu with the property market . </seg>
<seg id="18">According to the data , it seems that the revenues from the business is also increasing . </seg>
<seg id="19">Firms in the region by the income tax commercial companies $ 2.3 billion , which has increased from 2.1 billion from 2012 . </seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland on income tax commercial companies chose $ 1 billion , the most in the region . </seg>
<seg id="21">Although we were moving in the same direction , local tax burden on entrepreneurs is growing in these three places as quickly . </seg>
<seg id="22">The rate of growth in d.c. was at the level of the national average , at a 4.3 % , while growth marylandu was significantly higher 4.9 % . </seg>

<seg id="3">The announcement of a surprise , not because no one would have expected twitch someone buying , but because it is expected that the buyer depending will youtube . </seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago was selling twitche googlu for one billion , and this link appeared to be a natural . </seg>
<seg id="5">Twitch , which only three years ago , was a justin.tv primed to become widely used video streamingovou service - lively version youtube . </seg>

<seg id="9">The fact is that the youtube in popisutwitche comes to a lot , so the report that youtube kupujetwitch , no power nevzrušily , it was a textbook example of how the society pays possible competition . </seg>
<seg id="10">A mystery is why an agreement with youtube did not work , even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as amazon . </seg>

<seg id="3">On the subject of ' holy fonts are the divine word ' . </seg>
<seg id="4">Annexed the original video . </seg>
<seg id="5">The second basic lies christianity is the belief that the sacred texts have been written by god and not the actual human authors . </seg>
<seg id="6">When the faithful debating one of the many things that are at odds with their religion , often us stand before the question : who will believe ? </seg>
<seg id="7">The alleged božímu word , or the word man ? </seg>
<seg id="8">As if the investigation was completely trivial in comparison with the authority that is that it is their doctrine . </seg>
<seg id="9">Yet , when they say ' you ' , talks about science . </seg>
<seg id="10">And when reporting to the word ' , ' božímu reporting to the myths of god facing people . </seg>
<seg id="11">If there is indeed a smart with tvořitel with a view to , then it is he who created the fossil record , which reveals the evolutionary history , and this must be the one who invented genetic patterns , which they are responsible , and it must be , add another series of evidence showing exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail . </seg>
<seg id="12">Why would otherwise all of these things have existed ? </seg>
<seg id="13">It seems as if we tried to say something ! </seg>
<seg id="14">People could not create any of these things . </seg>
<seg id="15">But people can tell stories fabulovat . </seg>
<seg id="16">And they were people who write all the texts that pretend that the word of god . </seg>
<seg id="17">Any supposedly holy learning any religion in the world itself as the will of the people , not the gods . </seg>
<seg id="18">People who have been moved by ' ' or ' inspired by ' their favourite gods , or the need to listen to the dictates of angels , but these texts have been written by more than mere smrtelníky with a certain degree of imagination , not angels and certainly not gods . </seg>
<seg id="19">If there is indeed one real god , would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions , über-galaktický supergénius ultimátní entity , the space . </seg>
<seg id="20">If being such size sometimes wrote a book , there would be only one such paper , one which . </seg>
<seg id="21">It would be known everywhere in the world , without predecessors , drawing parallels or alternatives in any language , as mere account of authors , with this work could not measure . </seg>
<seg id="22">And people would it not blind trust , because it was a consistent , underpinned by verifiable and true evidence and kingly functions , deep morality and wisdom far above all human limits . </seg>
<seg id="23">Permanently would inspired each readers to unity common faith . </seg>
<seg id="24">If it were written by god , we did not expect nothing less . </seg>
<seg id="25">But what we see instead , it is the exact opposite . </seg>
<seg id="26">Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth we have many different religion without a common origin and all the continuously fragment into increasingly separate denomination , seeking a disputed truth and each is somehow a divine leadership , regardless of the continuing the divergence and decoupling in every respect . </seg>
<seg id="27">Was the jewish , christian , islamic the koran , bahá ' with ' lláhův kitáb-i-akdás , zarathuštrovy avesty , sikhský adí-granth , mahabharátská bhagavad-gita or paper , paper mormonova urantia are all considered ' absolute right ' and ' revealed word a genuine single god ' and the life of each of them say that others are wrong . </seg>
<seg id="28">The only logical explanations probably is that people are , to a certain extent . </seg>
<seg id="29">None of the aforementioned books has compared to other no advantage . </seg>
<seg id="30">None of them has the backing and no cannot be historically confirm . </seg>
<seg id="31">My name is as paul maier , and i am a professor of ancient history to western michiganské university . </seg>
<seg id="32">I am not saying that i am proved that the bible is reliable and historic accurate . </seg>
<seg id="33">Of course , it is not . </seg>
<seg id="34">Still , you must have faith . </seg>
<seg id="35">All of them require faith and also apologia ( defending ) , because it contains irregularities , absurdity and primitive ideas once considered true that have already been overcome . </seg>
<seg id="36">So we cannot claim that they are proof of the divine wisdom . </seg>
<seg id="37">Many of them promotes heinous atrocities instead of morality and many of them have argued that were confirmed by the fulfilment of prophecy - with the fact that every also may contain prophecy that has not been fulfilled . </seg>
<seg id="38">The leading theologians concede that all of the sacred texts of any religion were written by lidskýma hands and are subject to interpretation , images and perspectives of their primitive and often prejudices consumer politically motivated authors , thereby explain much of contradictions and inconsistencies in these books , especially those in bibli . </seg>
<seg id="39">I would not call it contradictions , instead of comments . </seg>
<seg id="40">We must point out once again that we have two different authors , whose work was somehow smíchána together during any redaktorské revision . </seg>
<seg id="41">It is right that the genesis has more than one of the author , and certainly not with its tale heard an eyewitness ! </seg>
<seg id="42">Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for pentateuch , i.e. five books ' mojžíšových ' and mojžíšovi nepřipisují authorship any of them , because almost certainly did not exist , as it is in bibli described . </seg>
<seg id="43">Experts agree that genesis was formed ( probably ezdrášem ) from several mutually for unrelated oral traditions of less than 2500 years ago . </seg>
<seg id="44">Other documents have been přefiltrovány at the same time , all are attributed to human authors . </seg>
<seg id="45">The bible is not by chance that the old , as its believers think . </seg>
<seg id="46">Svitky from dead sea is the oldest archeologickými findings texts known for its unfinished basis for all western monotheistic faiths , and yet they are for many centuries younger than roots zoroastriánství , buddhism , hinduism , helénismu , druidských cults , chinese or the egyptian religion . </seg>
<seg id="47">Christianity has as gnostická belief , follow docéti and ebionité and their completely different perspectives on ježíše which will combine in a compromise entitled orthodoxy . </seg>
<seg id="48">Other christian groups as luciferiáni were dispersed by and discredited other revisions . </seg>
<seg id="49">One of these uprav relates to the king ugaritu , which ruled against 3,500 years ago . </seg>
<seg id="50">Because of his followers constitute major risk for young mojžíšké religion , the authors of the new law decided to mock and even ' al zebula ' master of mount ' change on belzebuba ' master much ' . </seg>
<seg id="51">So the bible was deliberately and fraudulently modified both religious and political reasons . </seg>
<seg id="52">The remaining part of what has happened to the new law was kanonizována in the 4th century a.d. in a series of komisních decisions on the bundestag in nikaji . </seg>
<seg id="53">Four of the gospel was adopted and 16 have been rejected by the eye , as if the fact that some things have to accept or reject the vote . </seg>
<seg id="54">The way for developed depended on what is read on sundays in the christian centres . </seg>
<seg id="55">What is the second reading on sunday after velikonocích in jeruzalemské church ? </seg>
<seg id="56">And what , in the roman church in the same time ? </seg>
<seg id="57">And gradually find that it was close to those same evangelijním stories . </seg>
<seg id="58">And so the canon is made from the wisdom of the church . </seg>
<seg id="59">So they simply adopted as gospel any relevant stories that flows between uneducated masses at that time . </seg>
<seg id="60">But so deliberately they have received more than ten books of the bible , even though they covered books , which have been approved . </seg>
<seg id="61">Between odmítnutými headings as we find the files of the apostles and false prophets . </seg>
<seg id="62">Why should we divine word should refer to books , which are just words , some people and / or have or are not available ? </seg>
<seg id="63">Who was a real editor ? </seg>
<seg id="64">The bible is often mentions human authors . </seg>
<seg id="65">But how could be approved in this way , if the god real the author of this random míchanice legends , parable enough and žalmové lyrics ? </seg>
<seg id="66">The bible was certainly written people and certainly not too osvíceními , rather the contrary ! </seg>
<seg id="67">That is the reason why it is so much of its content historically and scientifically completely wrong , whether it is almost anything from beginning to end . </seg>
<seg id="68">We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys can speak , believed in spells , bloody victims , ritual charm , očarované objects ohnivé astrology nostrums , and five elements art . </seg>
<seg id="69">They thought that when we use a charming @-@ rod that someone postříkají blood , cure him from leprosy . </seg>
<seg id="70">We are talking about people who thought that pigs are přežvýkavci and netopýři are birds and whales are fish and i write that is the whole number . </seg>
<seg id="71">These people believed that , when will show pregnant every pruhované models , gives birth pruhovaná calves . </seg>
<seg id="72">How would this could tell someone who knows something about genetics ? </seg>
<seg id="73">The authors of this book that , of course , did not know . </seg>
<seg id="74">If the bible as it was written some higher beings , then it does not contain such errors , which contains . </seg>
<seg id="75">If this is not really the parent beings and was supposed to be a literal history , then there was nothing from what it contains . </seg>
<seg id="76">As a moral guides totally failed because the majority of the original hebrejských files it was written uneducated and bigotními divochy , who ignored or support cruelty to animals , incest , slavery , abuse of slaves , abuse of family members , the abuse of children , violence against children , abortion , looting , murder , kanibalismus , genocide and prejudice against the race , nation , religion , gender , and sexual orientation . </seg>
<seg id="77">To defend their inhumanity by claiming that god will take place . </seg>
<seg id="78">But the creationists all this is ignored . </seg>
<seg id="79">Some of their websites admit that , if there is any point in contravention of the bible , then it must be ignored . </seg>
<seg id="80">And why ? </seg>
<seg id="81">Because if the creationists should not their loved ones books , they should not god . </seg>
<seg id="82">In their world is one and the same thing . </seg>
<seg id="83">It is ironic that refuse to god ' work ' as ' worship creatures instead creator ' . </seg>
<seg id="84">But they consider the word of god and man for the word of god and even insist that refutation of their supposedly ' holy ' books somehow disproves god as such . </seg>
<seg id="85">Rather than their version of god but all versions of god . </seg>
<seg id="86">Kreacionističtí christians think that if the bible is wrong , then god is lying . </seg>
<seg id="87">It cannot accept that god could be and the bible , at the same time , could be wrong , because we cannot separate from saragossa doctrine . </seg>
<seg id="88">So it is a kind of modlářství where believers praise man made compilations , as if these books were the god , because they think that his word . </seg>
<seg id="89">But never winston nediktoval god nor any of the writings of any religion . </seg>

<seg id="1">Putin asks kyjev to eastern ukrajinou began negotiations on the “ national sovereignty ” </seg>
<seg id="2">According to the events of the russian newspaper asked on sunday russian president vladimír putin that the ukrainian government to fight the separatists in the east of the country and immediately opened negotiations on the “ national sovereignty ” of the breakaway regions . </seg>
<seg id="3">His interlocutor dmitrij peskov later explained that putin its point did not intend to suggest that the eastern ukrajiny under the control of the separatists will become part of the ruska , but that their status within the ukrajiny should be reviewed to russian @-@ speaking area has the power to protect their rights and interests . </seg>
<seg id="4">Putinova challenge you can see the government to act with proruskými rebels as equals , is a clear strategy , according to which follows from the unrest five months ago : help separatists to occupy territory and donuťte ukrainian government to grant the newly vyhlášenému novorusku de facto independence , to take place with the west could combine with ruskem . </seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with the state television channel putin condemned the military action , to regain the eastern area doněcka and luhansku which , in march and april took control of the separatists after moskva 18 march annexed krymský peninsula belonging ukrajině . </seg>
<seg id="6">Kreml and separatists recently occupied territories have described as “ novorusko ” or “ new russian , ” a term which refers to the famous předrevoluční days of the russian empire . </seg>
<seg id="7">Russia ’ s news agency itar-tass published putinova words , according to which it is “ prisoner illusion ” anyone who believes that are on the horizon peace negotiations , because the ukrainian politicians started before the parliamentary elections on 26 october campaigns , while the government forces attacking the civilian population in the areas of controlled separatists . </seg>
<seg id="8">“ in the interests of the people living in these areas , we need to launch a meaningful negotiations and not only the legal issues , but also a political organisation of society and on the status of state sovereignty of the south @-@ east ukrajiny , ” he said . </seg>
<seg id="9">Peskov said that putinova reference to national sovereignty was intended in the context of a broader autonomy , which , with the leadership of kyjeva is already several months and which is to mitigate the concerns of the russian @-@ speaking regions from the threat of cultural and linguistic rights . </seg>
<seg id="10">Peskov said that the autonomy of the eastern regions can only give the ukrainian government . </seg>
<seg id="11">It is not a matter for discussion between ukrajinou and ruskem peskov , said , “ because this is not a conflict between ruskem and ukrajinou , but on the internal ukraine ’ s conflict . ” </seg>
<seg id="12">Intervention spokesman kremlu which should correct interpretation of the “ wrong ” putinových points out the approach to tackling the separatists ruska leadership in the east , which is different from open the krymu , where the majority of the population of origin dvoumilionové among ethnic rusům . </seg>
<seg id="13">Moskva should be much more difficult to annex and doněck and luhansk on east ukrajiny , because the majority of 6.5 million people are not rusové and opinion polls carried out before the conflict has shown broad support for the remaining on ukrajině . </seg>
<seg id="14">Autonomy , which russian diplomats have acted in international fora , regional governments on ukrajině has the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations , and in fact so give kremlu de facto control over the territory , which would have combined with russian mainland krymem . </seg>
<seg id="15">The black sea peninsula anektovaný five months ago is the seat of the russian fleet , maritime trade background and historic coastal resort . </seg>
<seg id="16">The area between the russian rostovem and krymem are also centre down factories and sléváren that produce the important components for the russian army . </seg>

<seg id="18">This vision of autonomy , but very different from vision kremlu and separatists . moskva is accused of militarisation and the incitement to violence . </seg>
<seg id="19">Putinova last appeal to the separatists kyjev acted as equals followed the progress of the insurgents last week after the eastern ukrajinu leaked russian troops and tanks from before a quiet area along the azovského sea . </seg>
<seg id="20">Separatists stronger rusy novoazovskem take control of such a force that ukraine 's security authorities concerned that it is on the march in order to fill a strategic coastal territories to krym . </seg>
<seg id="21">This has accelerated the tremendous civilian and military efforts opevnit mariupol , port with metalurgickými kombináty about 500 000 inhabitants , which lies between novoazovskem and close the door on krymský peninsula . </seg>
<seg id="22">Porošenko on saturday at meetingu leaders of the european union in bruselu and urged action to prevent further russian aggression against ukrajině , a former soviet republic , which is the last 23 years of independent . </seg>
<seg id="23">" we are coming to a point of no return , ” he warned porošenko . </seg>
<seg id="24">On the territory of ukrajiny is now thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks . </seg>
<seg id="25">The summit aanwezig did not put any definitive steps - leaders are calling for the adoption of additional sanctions against rusku in the case of closer unspecified escalation of the ukrainian crisis . </seg>
